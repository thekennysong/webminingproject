"The Emoji Movie","Meh-","M. Watts","I was really excited about the emoji movie! I took my son to the theater to see it. It was so boring. I wanted to like it, but I just didn't. It wasn't anything I expected and it reminded me too much of ""Wreck it Ralph"". My 6 year old likes it, but I personally did not/do not enjoy it.","2.0 "

"The Emoji Movie","Good movie for a 5 year old.","Love2Read","I need to clarify my review.  I gave it the number of stars a 50+ person who watched it thought it should receive.  If I would have asked my nephew, who is 5, how many stars it should receive, he would have given it 5 stars.  There isn't much to say about this movie because the title says it all.  It's a movie about emoji's.  Yes, someone actually made a movie about emoji's.  It was kind of cute at times and there wasn't any vulgar language or adult situations.","3.0 "

"The Emoji Movie","As bad as they say...","Anonymous332","There is no story line and the jokes are not great, even for kids. It really is as bad as people and other reviewers have said.

It could have been a cute concept, but unfortunately it was a terrible waste of my money to rent.","1.0 "

The music is nothing special. The characters run a gamut from uninteresting to outright annoying. The villain was found in a discount evil catalog, and the premise is designed solely to destroy your faith in humanity. Inside of the first five minutes, I realized I hated absolutely everything about this movie, and my little sister had to force me to finish it.My opinion never changed.","1.0 "

Clearly written by a stranger to emoji and teen culture. The cliche was suffocating. If you want to cause yourself physical pain, I strongly recommend. Causes lasting trauma and psychological damage. Sent me into a depressive spiral. The characters disturbing dependence on technology to the point where the malfunction of such resulted in the deterioration of their social life was depressing.

"The Emoji Movie","Meh.","Honest Opinion","Well, it's got a few clever moments and a handful of cheap laughs, but ultimately doesn't work. No surprise, I guess, considering this is a movie trying to turn emojis, apps, cloud services, mobile operating systems, and the Internet into cutesy anthropomorphic creatures and their semi-magical physical, living world. Frankly, the film seems to make up the ""rules"" of this world as it goes along, with the main characters finding ever more farfetched, implausible, and convenient methods of overcoming barriers. And... an emoji character who is a hacker, using a physical terminal that is running a computer program to interact with a source code that is physically and visibly represented? It's almost meta, but mostly just mess. And don't get me started on the incessant name-dropping of brand name apps/services throughout, from Candy Crush to Spotify. Cringes and groans aplenty.","1.0 "

"The Emoji Movie","I'm an adult FYI so this is an adult perspective review","Debra V","No one did not rent this for a child. I have no kids. I rented this because I'm basically a child and enjoy some thought free movies. Aka movies that don't make me think about all the stresses in life and are simple clean cute entertainment. Ultimately this did make me think though. It made me think about how badly the analogy this movie represents is. It made me think how it was possible for the main character to know what emotions he wanted to convey and how anyone would have the confidence to send a glitchy emoji that has what appear to be sporadic changes in expression. How could he possibly know the expressions he chose would be representative of his feelings. I mean seriously what if it flipped the bird? How did the emojis even really know how he felt all they found was one deleted email. How can they view the outside world yet not remember anything that happened that they witnessed? Why are the apps they're in making noise yet aren't activated? Why doesn't he just turn his phone off? What happens if he turns his phone off? Do new versions of the app characters get created every time he downloads an app he's deleted? And shouldn't his phone be bricked from pulling the plug mid erase? And why do they call it erase and not reset? Is that because they don't think little kids can understand the word reset? Then why is every thing else in this movie overly complicated? So you want to teach kids a lesson in a story that being different isn't bad while simultaneously teaching them that the only way to fix a problem is to erase it? Now I know why my mom didn't want us watching so many different children's shows. They dumb down concepts and yeah your kids that partial accuracy and explanation is perfectly fine as long as you finish and that there are no real consequences to your actions. This movie hurt my brain.Plus side, if you're a mindless child or a mindless parent and don't think about anything you observe then this movie is cute and entertaining.","4.0 "

"The Emoji Movie","It is ok.","JWINK","Although I won’t say that this is a great animated movie, it was better than I expected.  There are some funny and cute moments and it is clever how they created a story around the modern-day obsession with smart phones.  There is a little bit of something for both adults and kids to enjoy.  There are maybe some moments that are more for older kids or adult type jokes that may not be appropriate for a younger audience though but that will be up to individual parents to judge for themselves.  Although I personally think I have seen worse in other animated movies.  It is a great animated movie, I would say no but it isn’t as bad as critics say.  It is ok and fairly middle of the road animated movie.3 stars","3.0 "

"The Emoji Movie","An Adventure Set Inside a Smart Phone","James N Simpson","Had heard a lot of negativity about this movie but decided to give it a go. I'm glad I did, it isn't the greatest animated movie ever made, but isn't actually that bad either.  It's set inside a smart phone, so you've obviously got to be familiar with various apps and functions of those devices.  Being so and especially the references to actual apps like Candy Crush and Spotify, it will obviously become fairly dated a few years from now when other latest fads or methods of downloading music make those obsolete.  Candy Crush, I played that for a while about five years ago but I haven't played it since, I imagine most people would be the same.  Some of these apps younger kids (who are the target market) aren't likely to have used, and in the future new generations aren't likely to have even heard of.  They could still understand what is happening in the overall storyline of the Meh emoji (T.J. Miller) struggling to always show the face of Meh, when it has other emotions, who panics when it is chosen by the human boy who owns the phone when he selects it to respond to a message from the girl he likes but hasn't really ever talked to.  The Meh emoji having sent a different message, is sentenced to deletion since the other emojis and app characters know one fault in the phone will mean it (and the world they exist) will be deleted by the human owner.  So Meh along with the High Five emoji (James Corden) who was once popular but now forgotten about, flee robots programmed to delete Meh who chase him around the world of the smart phone. Along the way they encounter a female character with attitude called Jailbreak (Anna Farris) who thinks she might be able to use Meh's abilities to hack their way into The Cloud where they will be both safe, and all live a much more exciting life.It's a movie where there aren't really bad guys.  The other emoji's lead by the original smiley face emoji, have made their decision to have Meh deleted because literally the life of everyone else rests on him not malfunctioning again and causing their world with their lives to be no more.  The robot pursuers are doing what they should do.  Like if your human body was fighting a virus.Parts of the set up for the plot don't exactly make sense and seem more to be included just to get girl kid viewers as well as boys. I'm not sure why a boy's phone would have a dancing app, princess emojis and things like this?  Still I found the movie to be pretty entertaining.  If you get the region 4 DVD there's plenty of extras on it.","4.0 "
"The Emoji Movie","More Hollywood Propaganda","Derek Tombrello","I would have given this movie four stars if not for the feminist, political correct propaganda that has to permeate every movie made today. The movie is funny. I won't lie. It was a laugh a minute... and this is from someone who despises ""social media"" and doesn't even own a cell phone. Not only does the movie try to push the feminist agenda  with lines like ""women are always creating things that men are taking credit for"" and ""a woman doesn't have to wait a knight to save her"", it goes so far as to blatantly LIE to impressionable children to further their indoctrination. The head emoji in the movie is a perpetually happy female smiley. She introduces herself saying that she was the very first emoji. No. She wasn't. The original smiley emojis were non-gender specific. They were not male or female. Further, later on, JailBreak tells Meh that in the first emoji set, girls could only be princesses or brides. That's no where near true since the first emoji set didn't even HAVE male/female symbols! Like most drivel coming out of Hollywood, this is a good movie to watch if you see it at a friend's - i.e. you don't support Hollywood monetarily to see this propaganda - and if you are not a sheep easily influenced.","2.0 "

"The Emoji Movie","Five stars for doing the impossible","DANNY DOODOO","Okay, I'll be honest here. I have a knack for watching the most ridiculous, plot-devoid, cringey movies and actually enjoying them. My friends know this to be true, as I have forced them on many occasions to suffer through said movies. But little did I know that all that movie-watching was preparing me for one thing: The Emoji Movie.For one hour and thirty-one minutes I came face to face with my reckoning, the movie that would change my entire life and shape the rest of it. It reached down into the very depths of my soul, and there came a moment during the boat scene when I saw a glimpse of hell itself. Before I (finally) saw the movie, I prepared myself for that moment when the credits finally rolled, but little did I know that I would be met with overwhelming relief when The Emoji Movie finally ceased to plague my eyes.Congratulations, Tony Leondis. You have accomplished the impossible: making me cringe.","5.0 "

No, of course you haven't. I was reminded of Toy Story right of the bat but the Emoji movie lacks a good premise, interesting characters, genuinely funny writing, significant payoff... lets save time.Is it funny? No, despite being full of jokes or statements which I think where meant to be jokes but I'm not laughing.Is it clever? Not at all, the jokes which aren't just not funny also make no sense and the whole set up makes me think that it was the writers first draft.is it memorable? No, I literally forget it exists when it isn't in my line of sight.

Consider the day your eyes get to be blessed with this masterpiece the best day of your life, because to put it simply: it is the most well-directed film I have ever come across. Great movie, 11/10 would recommend.","5.0 "

Me on the other hand, not so much. I can usually get into children movies. Luckily, it was a short movie. Any longer, I would have left early.  They need to come up with some better ideas for family movies. It seems to be sequels or re makes of existing movies.  Toy Story and Despicable Me were  the last good kids movie that I enjoyed too. If I had to rate this it would be a 2. My son would rate it a 4.","3.0 "

"The Emoji Movie","This Movie Is Not For Everyone","steven","To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand The Emoji Movie. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Gene's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Apple, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Emoji Movie truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humor in Gene's catchphrase “meh”. I’m smirking right now. What fools... how I pity them.","5.0 "
"The Emoji Movie","Please save yourself","Tom Hancock","There is a reason this got such a low score on IMDb, not because it's bad choreography but the fact it is saying to kids, ""hey! Forget about actually being social, just be on your phone all the time"". Perhaps it's good for the millennial parents who shut their kids up with an iPad rather than ACTUALLY interacting with them, but to one with common sense this is just horrifying. If you ever want your kid to learn how to actually have a social life and you accidentally bought this film, do yourself a favor and place it where you keep the tide pods, far away from their grasp.","1.0 "

"The Emoji Movie","The Emoji Movie is indeed the best movie you will ever see","Andrew Maurice","The biggest master piece of our generation, the 2017 rendition of the Emoji Movie. Was by far the greatest work of cinema I've even seen. Ever since the announcement, I thought the pure concept was genius. As the date grew near, I was beginning to worry I over hyped it, but once the glorious day of July 28, 2017, came upon us, I knew...that it exceeded every expectation I ever had. The plot of this work of art is completely original and genius, as the movie progresses, you feel like you grow along with the characters such as Gene, Jailbreak, and High-Five as they go on their mystical journey. Each joke is well thought out, I laughed throughout the entire film without stopping for air. My only critique with the film, is that we don't see the romantic subplot of Gene and Jailbreak fully fleshed out. However, ever other aspect of the movie completely makes up for this, and that is why I give it the perfect score it deserves.","5.0 "

"The Emoji Movie","A Horrible Reminder How Kids Are so Addicted to Cyberspace","AmazonCustomer","This movie, ""The Emoji Movie"", is simply a negative reminder how tech-savvy and dependent children, preteens, and teens have become glued to smartphones and iPhones in the last ten years. And it's only growing. It basically encourages children to be on their cellphones nonstop as a form of communication, humor, relationships, and entertainment. There's no moral to the story. The main character, the ""Meh"" emoji, ventures out on a journey and becomes determined to become the perfect ""Emoji"" and emoticon, and to perfect his ""Meh"" whenever the phone user decides to include him in a text message. That's all.  I really do not recommend this movie, as there's nothing positive to it, nor is it funny or entertaining. It's pretty corny and cliche and just another reminder how dependent children have become to cyberspace, texting, and smartphones all over the world.","1.0 "

It's a blatant ripoff of several children's movies of the past 2 decades, most notably The Lego Movie, Inside Out and Wreck-It-Ralph, which are all far superior. The jokes are painful, the message is cliched and overdone without any twist to it, the world and plot make no sense, even towards a fantasy there's no logic to it, there's no very little personality towards any of the human characters, and the scenes with any song in them are excrutiating to bear through.

"The Post","Must See!","Russell","During the time this movie portrays I was actually somewhere else totally focused on trying to keep me and my troops stay alive versus what was happening at home.  So, I will not comment on the historical accuracy of this movie or how much artistic license Mr. Spielberg, et al., took with actual facts.  But, I saw it yesterday in the theaters and, as art, I thought it was fantastic!!!As for another, very critical reviewer's criticism of how the actual ""facts"" were portrayed by the movie, I wonder how much time he spent in the theater watching the movie versus in the restroom writing his review.As for Mr. Hanks and Ms. Streep, I thought they were ""spot on"" to the mental images (from reputation only) I have of them!  (But, two confessions here: (1) I have never met the real Ms. Graham nor the real Mr. Bradlee; and (2) I am a huge fan of Mr. Hanks, but not so much as to Ms. Streep.)The messages the movie attempts to make (and, I think successfully) resonate today.  While I wish some segments of the press today were as faithful to the diligent search for truth (and properly sourced reporting) as the New York Times and Washington Post reporters were in the movie, the all-out attacks on the legitimate press and freedom of the press I saw when I returned home 45 or so years ago and see today are not at all dissimilar.  If for no other reason, that is reason this movie is worth a watch especially if you did not live through that era in American history.I am frankly astounded with all the negative customer reviews of this movie.  (As would be the full theater I was in who applauded at ""The End"".)Maybe the messages did not resonate with the customer reviewers and this is their way to register disagreement. To bad that being ""open-minded"" today is not in vogue.  Frankly, when I learned about the Supreme Court's ""Pentagon Papers"" decision, I was very unhappy that it could potentially put me and my troops in danger.  But, I came to appreciate that our First Amendment dictated the decision the Supreme Court made. If you do not like that, fine.  Change or abrogate the first Amendment, but don't castigate a movie for it.","5.0 "
"The Post","Deep and moving","wiredweird","I wasn't of political age when these events happened. But, as an adult, seeing them played out, I am profoundly moved by the personal bravery involved in bringing these reports to the public.“It takes a great deal of courage to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends.” Rowling's words, perhaps, but a truth much older - and played out here with visceral intensity. The very real threat of prison, of loss of livelihood, of loss of everything they'd worked for: those immediate realities could not be ignored, and those at risk weighed them seriously. But what really motivated the news staff to expose the papers? Patriotism, as they saw it, perhaps, Headlines as corporate life preserver - well the news seemed as likely to kill the paper as save it, so that might cancel out. The ideal of the free press - think what you will about idealism. It must have been a boiling stew of all these things and more, simmering differently in each person involved, and I think Spielberg and crew conveyed that eloquently. And the reality of being on Nixon's ""enemy list"" - maybe an honor in some way, but damaging to careers and businesses, as well, and not to be risked lightlyBut, along with epochal news-breaking, there were other, smaller moments true to the time. My best beloved, an ageless marvel, had come of age in that era, when women were to be seen and not heard, She had a few harsh moments watching this film, and having that oppressive past come back, and seeing Streep's character fight against it. (A scene at the very end, Streep pushing through a crowd of admiring women, might lack literal truth even if it conveys something later commentators had come to understand.) This renders an important moment of modern history in a vivid and sensitive way. I'm glad I saw it.Really, though, I might never want to see it again, and I mean that in the most respectful way.- wiredweird","5.0 "

"The Post","“The press was to serve the governed, not the governors.“","amerdale876","One of the most important and timely releases to come along is a story that I believe should be required knowledge: the lies of the government concerning the official beginning of American involvement in the Vietnam War. The film follows the country's first female newspaper publisher, Kay Graham (Meryl Streep), of The Washington Post, who comes into possession of classified documents now known as ""The Pentagon Papers,"" which detailed how the federal government, among other things, that the Presidents Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson administration systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress, revealing specifically that the U.S. had secretly enlarged the scope of its actions in the Vietnam War with the bombings of nearby Cambodia and Laos, coastal raids on North Vietnam, and Marine Corps attacks, none of which were reported in the mainstream media, as well as the advisors' and analysts' opinion that the war was unwinnable (and they sent troops anyway). These documents would inevitably lead to the revelation that the infamous 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, which fully got America involved in the Vietnam War, was partially lied about in that the second attack on American warships by the North Vietnamese on August 4, 1964, never happened. This film chronicles the fight between Graham, Post editor Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks), and the President Richard Nixon administration. What is especially great is Steven Spielberg's utilization of actual Nixon White House recordings (no reenactments) to showcase just how pissed off Nixon and his staff were during this time. After hearing of Nixon's demanding to ban the Washington Post from coming to the White House, one can't help but parallel Nixon with Donald Trump's current administration, which uses very similar tactics and has similar opinions as Nixon when it comes to the press as well as the American people's right to information (or lack thereof). “The Post” is an absolute must-see film, showcasing the importance of the public's right to information when it comes to the government, the importance of a free press, as well as a history of our country's corrupt politics and methods which sadly didn't teach us a lesson as evidenced by the election of today's president.","4.0 "

"The Post","4 1/2 stars.  Superlative performances and one of the best films of 2017","M. Oleson","Theater review.  Possible spoilers.  It would seem that this film featuring one of our great American newspapers, is perfectly timed as the press is seemingly under attack from the highest levels of our government.  In 1971, a civilian employee of the Rand Corporation was working with the defense department.  Primarily documenting the long war in Vietnam.  A study was instigated by Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood) to look at the U. S. involvement.  It turns out that unknown to almost everyone, the American participation goes back to Harry Truman’s administration.  With each president that followed, the involvement escalated.The employee, Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys) discovers that under presidents Johnson and Nixon, it was concluded that the war could not be won, yet troops were constantly being sent to do battle…and die.  Ellsberg copies and releases thousands of pages of what was known as The Pentagon Papers to the New York Times who publishes some of the pages, much to the consternation of Nixon.  The administration immediately get a court order that prevents further publication.  In steps the Washington Post, who at the time wasn’t considered a significant national paper and certainly no real competitor to The Times.The publisher was Kathrine (Kay) Graham (Meryl Streep), whose father had owned the paper until he died.  He willed the paper to Kay’s husband who died a few years later.  Until this time, Kay was a wealthy socialite whose primary purpose was to throw extravagant parties for the wealthy and well placed.  McNamara was one of her best friends.  The paper was primarily run by Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks), the editor-in-chief.  Bradlee and specifically investigative reporter Ben Bagdikian (Bob Odenkirk), develop leads that result in getting copies of the same documents from Ellsberg.The second half of the film deals with the decision to publish or not publish given the restraining order placed on the New York Times.Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, the film is a taut thriller from the same cloth as “Spotlight” and “All the President’s Men.”  I’m one of those people who think the Academy could give an Oscar for just about every film Streep and Hanks appear in.  They won’t of course, but there is no reason they shouldn’t this year.  Streep in particular gives a great performance as we see the shy publisher grow throughout the film, stepping into places she’s never been before.  Her mannerisms, facial tics, voice inflections seem perfect.  I saw several interviews with Bradlee over the years and while Hanks doesn’t look much like him, the voice cadence and clipped speech seems spot on.  I will also mention Odenkirk’s performance is terrific as the reporter willing to dive into the fray.Spielberg’s direction is perfect.  The film runs just under 2 hours and flies by quickly.  The inner workings of the newspaper from the reporters to the machinery in the basement cranking out the paper is interesting and informative.  The film has a strong supporting cast including Sarah Paulson, Tracy Letts, Bradley Whitford, Alison Brie, Carrie Coon, Jesse Plemons, David Cross and others.  While they don’t have central roles, Spielberg allows each to have a well-written scene.  The film is primarily about the growth of Mrs. Graham but also about the importance of a free press in this country.  We know that Nixon claimed “I am not a crook.”  Well, he was as it turns out.  One of the best movies of 2017.  Highly recommended.","5.0 "
"The Post","A topical, strongly-directed and accomplished film","Charles","I wouldn't count Steven Spielberg as one of my favorite directors. My taste has always leaned towards the bolder, provocative, and more challenging filmmakers and Spielberg just isn't one of them. There's no denying, however, that he is a master of his craft and most definitely deserves his reputation as one of the best. The Post is yet another convincing argument for his talents. His direction here is fluid, commanding, energic, and muscular. It always serves the story, never calling attention to itself or becoming overly showy. His camera is dynamic and constantly in motion, giving a sense of vitality to what could otherwise be mundane dialogue sequences, and he thoughtfully blocks his scenes to further that sense of movement. He also has a great feel for the peaks and valleys of a film, expertly sequencing the scenes to bring out the dynamics of the story. You feel the tension and the weight of the pivotal scenes in this film all because of how well Spielberg conducts this symphony. And furthermore, the movie is quite timely and tells a true story of great relevance in our current political climate. I have to add as well that Meryl Streep gives a fantastic performance and plays a character with considerable depth and an emotionally satisfying arc. As for criticisms, it takes a bit of time to really get going and can be a bit hard to follow before you understand who all the characters are in relation to one another. Do I think this is a film I'll be watching for years to come? Probably not. But it is no less an excellent, accomplished, and topical film that I very much enjoyed and would solidly recommend.4/5","4.0 "
"The Post","Topical Treasure in the Shadow of Watergate","drqshadow","Another journalistic thriller from one of Spotlight's screenwriters, another Oscar nomination. This time we're investigating the pre-Watergate struggle between the government and the free press, a fight that went all the way to the supreme court and drew the personal ire of President Nixon. So loaded with parallels to the current social climate that director Steven Spielberg sprinted it through production, it's well-made but rushed, straightforward and more than a little familiar. Most impressive is Meryl Streep, who conveys vast inner turmoil as Kay Graham, marginalized publisher of the Washington Post, as she labors to balance her writers' integrity with an impending IPO that could potentially sink the paper. Kay's growth is what really drives the chariot, a compelling counterpoint to the journalistic sleuthing and boardroom/courtroom decisions that don't directly involve her. We see her resigned to the sitting room with the other ladies so the boys can talk politics, willingly accepting her preordained role in society, then slowly grow bolder and more outspoken as the waters grow dicier. She's never completely confident, especially in the one pressure-packed phone call that signifies her pivot, but that makes her all the more interesting and sympathetic. Where the antagonistic relationship between President and press signifies an obvious complement to Trump's war on fake news, Graham's battle is an equally appropriate nod to the recent push for women's rights. Rich and pertinent, it's an engaging watch, but the workmanlike, by-the-numbers production and hollow, lackluster climax left me feeling a little flat.","4.0 "
"The Post","Brilliant Film That Trump Supporters Will Hate","Tom Trifonoff","This is a very clever and extremely well thought out film. The parallels between the Nixon Presidency and that of tRump are cleverly interwoven-as they should be. Any leader or government trying to stifle the free press is nothing short of dictatorship. The Post is a brilliant film on all counts. Tom Hanks is effectively inspirational as Ben Bradlee, while Meryl Streep is equally effective in a more restrained role as Katherine Graham, the owner of the Washington Post.It's no wonder why Trump supporters would be so quick to denounce this film with their gung-ho one star rating-they know only all too well the parallels between the Nixon and Trump presidencies.

"The Post","Surprisingly milquetoast treatment of an important event.","Robert Blenheim","Steven Spielberg’s otherwise honorable “The Post”, the story of the Washington Post’s struggle to publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971, suffers from a rather polite, academic film treatment that lacks the rough edge the story deserved (check out “All the President’s Men” again!).  It needed more adrenaline.Moreover, a miscast Tom Hanks seemed to be playing 'Tom Hanks' rather than Ben Bradlee -- although Meryl Streep's nuanced and brilliant performance as Katharine Graham made the film really worth seeing.  Streep alone makes this worth 4-stars.Although this is the kind of film non-cineastes mistake for great, ""The Post"" shows Spielberg directing on autopilot.  Still recommended for being a record of an important moment in the political history of America.","4.0 "
"The Post","As engaging a movie as Baby Driver.","Clyde","Ironically, in comparison to the other Oscar nominated movies I've watched for this season, this one was the most engaging and fast moving.  This even compared to war time movies like Dunkirk and The Darkest Hour.  And who cares how accurate it is.  Certainly more true to life than The Shape of Water or Baby Driver. OK, maybe ""Baby Driver"" was just as engaging...  but come one, a story about whether or not publishing something is just as engaging as a car chase movie?  That's pretty good writing and directing.","4.0 "
"The Post","Interesting","Christopher Schwinger","I did not know until watching this that the Washington Post would not be one of the premiere newspapers of the country today except for the Pentagon Papers.  I still feel somewhat confused about what government lies were exposed by the papers even after seeing it, other than maybe 3-4 facts the movie gave, and I didn't fully understand the papers' journey from leaking to publication.  But I had fun watching the events in the movie, even though I didn't always know the significance of a character.Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks are among the most decent people in the movie industry, and I like that they've collaborated a number of times.  I think the critics' love for this movie has more to do with the Trump-vs.-media war than the movie's merits per se.  It's an interesting movie and moves at a good pace, but it struck me as just a worthwhile story told in an engaging way, not particularly profound in the way it's written.  So I wouldn't assess it in the same way as the critics.  Plus the media-vs.-Trump war is personality-driven and ideology-driven (it's both things), while the Pentagon Papers were about revealing the truth to the American people about government corruption, kind of like Edward Snowden's leaking.  That's very different than today.  One of the moments which feels so ""Spielberg"" to me in this movie is a moment which is featured in the trailer where the flight attendant asks what's in the parcel and the man says ""Just government secrets.""  She thinks he's joking.Perhaps the stronger relationship in the movie than even Katharine Graham's with Ben Bradlee's (Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks together) is hers with Robert McNamara.  The most interesting conversations to me in the movie were the ones about the personal relationships the two main characters had with important government people.  There's also a really sweet scene where Katharine Graham remembers her late husband.  I like how the movie shows the dual purpose of newspeople's fancy dinners with government people, pretending to be personal but really being about getting a good scoop.  Little Spielberg touches like the coins falling onto the sidewalk as a man makes an urgent call on a pay phone are also memorable.  It's usually the little details which make moments memorable in this movie.  I suppose I'd notice more of these if I see it again.  Perhaps the reason I didn't notice his directing was because he was so good at doing his job as a storyteller.There are a couple things I'd change about the script.  I'd make a bit of an effort to add dialogue which explains the connections of characters better and says a few more things about what's in the Pentagon Papers.  I'd also aim for less realism and for a more palatable listening experience when we're in the presence of Ben Bradlee and other newsmen.  In their line of work in that era, I know from my reading that they really cussed frequently in normal conversations.  Still, every filmmaker (writer or director or actor) has to choose how much cussing to include when depicting a historical character or culture or period.  I've thought about that also on Rob Reiner's new ""LBJ"" film and the movie ""Patton"".  If you do not personally use such language in that way/with that frequency, how much is morally okay to include if you're making a movie about someone who did?  It didn't bother me much, other than posing that question, because in reality, Spielberg and Hanks are not profane people.I like that in period films like this, when they're made today, smoking is shown as a token thing, rather than 20-30 seconds of long puffs like in the black and white era (such as Humphrey Bogart in ""Casablanca""--and I can't figure out why that is so pleasing of a movie to some people).  I didn't really notice John Williams's music too much, though what I noticed was fine.  Not a particularly memorable score, but that's fine.  I didn't feel a sense of admiration for the main characters really, either, strangely enough.  I felt a sense of interest in what they were about to do, but maybe the movie was doing its job by making it about the papers rather than the internal conflicts of these two main characters.  That's how it felt to me, and I'm sure some would disagree.  It seems like the main purpose of the movie was just to tell an interesting story about the Pentagon Papers with a caution about the importance of a free and RESPONSIBLE press.  (Even Trump would agree if I worded it that way.)It's a good movie.","4.0 "
"The Post","Great movie - great acting.","Mark Bickham","Historically accurate account made interesting, intense, and suspenseful. I'm not sure why a true story would be classified as left or right leaning, it's rather absurd to put down a movie based on a ""true story"" claiming it pushes an agenda. What I enjoyed most about it was that a woman who had everything to lose chose to be brave -- which was dangerous, risky, and could have had terrible consequences. The acting was superb, and the movie proved a fine point: You can claim to believe whatever you like, but you cannot rewrite history. I enjoyed the movie, and I would recommend anyone see it if they enjoy knowing more about how close we came to seeing the press as we know it become silenced by our lawmakers.","5.0 "
"The Post","Don't be put off by the 1 star reviews - this is a wonderful film - story, acting,and  production.","Jean","Far more compelling to watch than I was led to believe. This is not only a commentary on freedom of the press, and the real potential danger of printing ""leaked"" stories, but also a great commentary on the era. Some are critical that the story becomes about Streep's character, but I did not find that to be true - where the story intersects with the fact that the owner of the ""Post"" was a female - it is pertinent to understanding her decision making.I was hesitant to buy this due to the cranky 1 star reviews, but I do not regret it at all. It is fantastic story telling with great actors (all the actors - not just the leads). I will go one step further, and say that there is NO WAY this movie adds up to a one star review - a star for acting, one for the story, and another for production (watching the old printing press fire up was great), now that is at least three stars. Perhaps some don't like the subject matter, and to them I would say ""why did you watch it in the first place?""","5.0 "
"The Post","""I'm not asking your permission...I'm asking your advice.""","E.M. Bristol","""The Post"" opens not in a newsroom, but in the jungles of Vietnam as Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys) is serving his country and risking his life on a regular basis and then once he returns and gets a job with the government, he happens upon the famous Pentagon Papers which reveals the unpalatable truth that multiple Presidents and their administrations knew full well that the Vietnam War was unwinnable yet did nothing to save the lives of those who fought in it. So he decides to do a little leaking to the media which happens to be The New York Times. Fast forward to Kay Graham (Meryl Streep), the owner of The Washington Post after her husband committed suicide, sitting bolt upright in bed from solid slumber because that is the only way people wake up in the movies, and also to indicate that she is worn out from juggling business decisions about her newspaper - especially, as she has never done this sort of thing before until her husband's death. Also, she is a woman, and the only bigwigs with whom she interacts are all men. Who are still making their way out of the thicket of pre-feminism, although still respectful to Meryl, as a gentleman would to any proper lady.When Meryl meets Post bigwig Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) for breakfast in a smoke-filled men's club, Tom bemoans the fact that a reporter at The Times, who has scooped them in the past, seems to be Up to Something. Soon Tom is sending an employee over to spy on The Times; eventually, they get scooped when The Times starts printing the papers. However, the Post gets a break of sorts when President Richard Nixon orders The Times to stop publishing The Truth and takes them to court. Now, it's up to Meryl to decide whether to continue to report on the papers, even if doing so means that ultimately there will no longer be a newspaper. Oh, and everyone involved will be in prison. (And there's another scandal just around the corner.)This is the kind of movie whch like ""Spotlight,"" another excellent journalism movie about the power of the press, will probably reap multiple Oscar nominations and perhaps Oscars, given the dual starpower of Meryl and Tom. Most everyone in my theater, who appeared unlike me to be old enough to remember this piece of history firsthand enjoyed it and even applauded at the end. I can't speak to historical accuracy, but it's quite excellent entertainment-wise and also, as many critics have noted, a timely topic these days.","5.0 "

"The Post","The Last Best Hope of a Democracy is a Press Unhindered by Governmental Power: Prequel to ""All the President's Men""","classicalsteve","Eisenhower, J. Kennedy, and L. Johnson all had positive contributions to the well-being of the United States. Eisenhower upheld the Supreme Court's decision to desegregate public schools in the South, Kennedy navigated the Cuban Missile Crisis, and Johnson signed into law Civil Rights Legislation. However, they all had one huge stain on their proverbial presidential suits: Vietnam. The United States' involvement in Vietnam was both a gross failure of foreign policy and a tragic military miscalculation with 10,000's of US soldier deaths and many more casualties from circa 1960 to 1975. Countless more Vietnamese, many of them unarmed civilians, were also casualties of the war. The story is rather timely because, at this writing, the current occupant of the White House disdains journalism and admonishes anyone in the Press who reports stories which are anything less than completely flattering of him and his administration.The main thrust of ""The Post"" is how the Washington Post obtains the Pentagon Papers, the secret classified report on the failure of Vietnam, and the decision-making process about publishing the story. A riveting story from beginning to end, and a wonderful send-up of the story which would follow shortly thereafter: the break-in of Democratic National Committee Headquarters at the Watergate Apartment Plaza in Washington D.C. Meryl Streep, in one of her most compelling performances, plays Graham as the house-wife turned executive owner who has to make some of the most crucial decisions about her company. Tom Hanks makes the best Ben Bradlee since Jason Robards played the role and won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.US Presidents, particularly L. Johnson and R. Nixon, felt the public couldn't handle the truth about the war, or, far worse, would view the war as failures and, God forbid, may hold their politicians accountable. The administrations did all they could to keep the public from knowing first-hand the details of the US' grand mess-up in Vietnam. Interestingly, the administration under Johnson commissioned a detailed report of Vietnam, which came to be known as the Pentagon Papers. The report was not to be made public but was intended for scholarly research long after the fact. It was produced when troops were still in Vietnam. ""The Post"" is about how the New York Times and eventually the Washington Post were leaked the Pentagon Papers and their decision to publish excerpts, inciting the fury of President Nixon and his Administration. The film begins with Dan Ellsberg making copies of the Pentagon Papers in the mid-1960's, and then the film fast-forwards to 1971.The Washington Post operating in DC was a relatively small local newspaper which inadvertently fell into the hands of Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep) after her husband (and Post owner) Philip Graham committed suicide in 1963. The Post is now poised to become publically traded on the stock market and evolve into a national and even international source of news reporting and journalism. While Graham is dealing with New York investor types, the New York Times had gotten hold of parts of the Pentagon Papers and were publishing them. Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) had smelled that their rival in New York was brewing some volatile story but failed to gather appropriate intelligence. Then the Justice Department issues an injunction against the Times prohibiting them from further publishing which is upheld by a New York judge. The ruling offers a window of opportunity for the Post.","5.0 "

History comes alive.  It is almost as good as watching a Brit movie about Winston Churchill braving the odds and making the hard decisions.  Tom Hanks gives a good performance.  Meryl Streep gives a GREAT performance.  We come away knowing what it was like to be Graham in her connections and the conflicts they made for her on so many levels, in her vulnerability and ambivalence, and in her realization that hers was the authority-- and we feel with her the thrill of claiming The Post as her paper now.

"The Post","The sum of its parts is greater than the whole.","John","I'd say most of the one star reviews I've on seen on here are borne out of some sort of dislike for the Washington Post or the actors because of their political views and some supposed liberal bias, all of which says more about the reviewer than the actual movie itself. In a time where journalistic outlets are constantly accused of delivering ""fake news"", this film is a great reminder that few things are as precious as the truth, and that telling the truth isn't always easy nor wins you many friends. It's as much a movie as it is a documentation of an actual sequence of events. The story is a constant tug of war between whether the Post will publish the Pentagon Papers or not, which is fine but a bit monotonous at times (especially if you know your history). Hanks and Streep both deliver good performances. One beef I have though, is Daniel Ellsberg was a national hero, and is integral to the actual events that took place, yet he's glossed over here. There's been better movies about the Pentagon Papers made with him as the focus. In all though, it's a good story about journalism and the sum of its parts is greater than the whole.","4.0 "

"The Post","THE POST: A Film Of Our Past, Our Present, And (Very Possibly) Our Future","Erik North","Many assumptions made about the freedom of speech in America were truly tested during the Vietnam War era, when it became evident to anyone watching the evening news on TV that what the press was telling us and what our government was telling us about that war were clearly diverging.  But those differences became manifestly evident in June 1971, when the New York Times began publishing the first volumes of documents leaked by former defense analyst Daniel Ellsberg that became known as the Pentagon Papers.  And when the Washington Post, a relatively small newspaper based in the nation’s capital, published them in defiance of a court injunction lodged against the New York Times for them doing it in the first place, this led to a collision between the need for governmental secrecy and the public’s right to know.  This is the story told by director Steven Spielberg in his masterful 2017 political drama THE POST.Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep star as, respectively, the Post’s managing editor Ben Bradlee and the paper’s publisher Katharine Graham, who are confronted with the reality that their as-yet-insignificant paper is losing out to the New York Times, even though they are located within spitting distance of the White House.  When the publishing of the Pentagon Papers hits the Times, they seem to be caught flat-footed; but Hanks is determined to get those same papers published in the Post itself.  But there are more than a few complications.  For one, the Post is about to go public on the American Stock Exchange; and the publication of the Pentagon Papers is a potentially fatal move.  For another, both Hanks and Streep have conflicting past loyalties to political figures, including former defense secretary Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood), whose actions implicate them in those papers.  And for still another, president Richard Nixon is out to squelch not only the publication of the papers, but seemingly also even the First Amendment completely.  Weighing all the options, including the fact that Hanks, Streep, and everyone else at the Post could find themselves going to jail forever, the decision is made to call the bluff and publish what Ellsberg gave, resulting in a clash between the two great powers in America, the press and the government, that goes all the way to the Supreme Court.Spielberg had already finished one film (the futuristic READY PLAYER ONE) when the Pentagon Papers script by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer landed in his hands in early 2017; and given the huge turmoil spawned by president Donald Trump’s frequent attacks on the press at the time (which has continued virtually non-stop since), the director felt that he couldn’t hold off and that he had to make THE POST and get it out to theatres first.  He did this in unusually rapid succession, filming it over a period of ten weeks in the spring and summer of 2017, and having it finished for release at the end of the year.  Despite this seeming rush, THE POST emerges as another huge masterpiece for a director who has had far more than his share of them.  A great deal of this comes from working with a crew that he has been familiar with on a vast majority of his films from SCHINDLER’S LIST onward, and to the usual masterful performances by Hanks and Streep, both of whom have to look a bit rumpled and even bedraggled at times, fitting the tenor of the early 1970s.  And it also doesn’t hurt that he has one of the great political stories in American history to work with: the publication of documents that revealed to the American public that their own government lied to them about a war that proceeded to divide the nation in a way that it had not been divided since the Civil War.  Spielberg’s scrupulous attention to detail also includes the insides of the Post’s huge printing presses, and the fact that actual typewriters were still being used in those days, as opposed to the electronic word processors of the 21st century.Besides Hanks and Streep, Spielberg gets solid performances from Greenwood; Matthew Rhys (as Ellsberg); Bob Odenkirk (as the Post’s main Ellsberg conduit Ben Begdikian), and Justin Swain (as Neil Sheehan, the New York Times reporter who broke the Ellsberg story first); and the film also uses a number of tapes from Nixon’s own White House from June 1971 to underline the sinister nexus of secrecy and paranoia that would eventually undo his administration, and almost undo the United States as a country in the bargain.  Add on a terse and tension-filled music score by John Williams, maybe the greatest composer of film music of all time, and what you have in THE POST is a film that will likely remain timeless because, particularly in 2017-18, it couldn’t possibly have been more timely.","5.0 "

Perhaps one had to be there or lived through the era to appreciate what it meant to stand up to the established order, especially for those who had a lot to lose (consider Mohammed Ali).  Back then, the press and the power elite in Washington had a symbiotic relationship, just as they do today.  But sometimes a compelling truth emerges that forces the press to choose sides:  either they report facts that will tarnish the reputation of those in power--and threaten their access to sources of news in the future--or they take the cautious route and adhere to the requirements of ""national security"", which of course is defined by those in power.  It may sound like an easy choice but it's not, and this movie presents the dilemma in a compelling way using a true story.  One wonders what would happen if a similar situation played out today.

"The Post","TO THE POST -  WRITE THIS STORY!","ldemar","BRAVO!DEAR POST - PLEASE INVESTIGATE AND WRITE THE BELOW STORY IN YOUR PAPER TO MAKE SURE THE BELOW NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN!My daughter recently died in a California hospital.  She was only 26, NOT terminally ill, AND BEGGED FOR HER LIFE.  I slept there every night because they kept eviserating her health every time I stepped away.  The last night of her life, we were watching a movie together and we both dozed off.  I work up ten minutes later to discover a nurse grinding something into my SLEEPING daughter's  FRESHLY PLACED feeding tube.  I quizzed the nurse about what she was doing and discovered she just ground 12 hour time release morphine (a drug my daughter was refusing per med record) into my SLEEPING DAUGHTER.  When I screamed DOESN'T THAT MAKE IT ALL INSTANT RELEASE?! the nurse ran out of the room.  I ran around the hospital begging for help, even downstairs to the all night pharmacy but the pharmacists just backed away from me refusing to help.  No doctor was anywhere to be found.  My daughter was overcome with hypoxia and began a 10 hour struggle to live, begging for her life, her pleas changing from begging for oxygen to,  in hours,  begging for her lungs to be pumped out saying her lungs were filling up with fluid please help me, I'M DYING.  There were 4 nurses in the room but the respiratory therapists were refusing to help.In the morning she died and I was told it was natural causes (death cert says cardiac arrest?!?).  At the time, I believed she died of medical error....until I read the medical records months later and  discovered it was not just ONE stupid veteran ICU nurse not knowing how to administered CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES OR TIME RELEASE MEDICATION but the entire TEAM of them.  EACH TIME KICKING OFF HYPOXIA, per the medical records.  Death was thwarted in the earlier attacks by me and Annies Dad demanding and helping her to enforce her will to live.  Hypoxia kicked off by morphine overdose and lasix is transient and goes away when the drugs leave your system and your blood pressure rebounds.  But of course, we didn't know at the time what was causing these attacks that lead my daughter to the ICU. The hearing transcripts report that these nurses admit to knowing that what they were doing was wrong; so you don't have to believe my opinion of this behavior.Reading the records further, I discovered my daughter didn't die of natural causes but because one of these nurses then at NOON gave her a lethal cocktail of propofol, fentanyl, ativan and atropine and kept blousing fentanyl until my daughter quit breathing.  Last bolus of fentanyl at 12:10, last breath at 12:15, last heart beat by 12:23... doesn't look like cardiac arrest to me.Three nurses have been ""administratively"" prosecuted by the attorney general and nursing board just for the morphine grinding attacks...these nurses are still working - never missed a day of work since my daughter's death almost 3 years ago?!?  The California nursing board has not yet made a decision about their licenses.  The transcripts of the hearing are available from Diamond Court Reporing, under the nurses names, for the dates January 9-11, and i have a copy as well.  Anyone can see the attorney general complaints against two of these  nurses that battered my daughter with ground morphine by going to the CA nursing board website and doing a serach on the names Roxy Graef and Shaukat Anwari.  These nurses also falsified the medical records stating my daughter swallowed these pills WHOLE.  These are public records and if what these nurses did is ok then there s/b no problem with everyone knowing about this.  If their behavior is not ok, then this is a matter of public safety because these nurses are STILL WORKING IN THE HOSPITAL and i haven't been able to get anyone to report on it or stop it for almost 3 years!!!  These nurses have spotless records but that is NO proof that they haven't done this before because we wouldn't know THIS STORY IF I DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN TO WAKE UP AND CATCH ONE OF THEM IN THE ACT.Did I miss a memo?  Did California legalize forced euthanasia?  In the transcript, the Attorney General states in her summation that my daughter was not terminally ill but WAS euthanized!  She asks out loud, ""How did that happen?""  saying the doctors had no answer.  How are these nurses STILL WORKING?!?Jeff!  please have your paper look at these documents and report on this so that no other innocent and vulnerable patient suffers this unimaginable torturous death.  Patients, with hoses in every orifice, have absolutely no ability to defend themselves and their loved ones have no way of verifying what drugs are being administered.  What I've discovered from reading the medical records is the larger story that NO NURSE is afraid of battering a patient with drugs they have refused and these same nurses cannot recognize immediate well known life threatening side effects of these doses.  While my daughter was alive, I constantly tried to get copies of the medical records so I could figure out what was going on, I had written authority from my daughter to get the records but the records dept kept losing the forms or telling me they were incorrectly filled out and i has to start all over again....one nurse actually told me that i couldn't get records until my daughter was out of the hospital because they were being ""used"" by the doctors and all LOCKED UP?!?...i have evidence for a lot of this funny business, texts and emails sent at the time trying to get the records.I will not hold it against amazon if this review doesn't get posted but PLEASE give it to JEFF!!!!

The One Star (barely grammatical) comments, have an obvious source, people who would like to the see press trashed. Instead of ""political agenda"" it might be more useful to notice we all need a robust free press, and stop swallowing the mantra of the media being the menace instead of the foul-mouthed liars calling for the media's suppression.  Speaking of which, I agree that Meryl Streep was ""suppressed"" as one critic said.  However, I am keeping in mind that I'm looking at 1971 through the lens of 2017 with perhaps different expectations.  She may have been seen as ""formidable"" but that may have emanated from her social status alone, rather than what we would call formidable behavior by a woman in a social setting today.  And anyone who doesn't think that room full of older men, her board members,  didn't talk over her at the first board meeting is clueless about what life was actually like for women then, social class or not.  Or it speaks to ignorance of behavior we still see today - by people who took no notice of  the Old White Men interrupting and suppressing Sen. Kamala Harris during recent hearings, as well as Sen. Elizabeth Warren.  There was something about the tone of the movie that reminded me of old war movies, a kind of rallying cry.  I think we need that rallying cry.

While the Times was publishing the story, the Post was covering the WH wedding. Katherine Graham (Meryl Streep,) the owner of the Post, was taking the company public on AMEX in order to save the floundering small town publication.The film was interesting but doesn't hit a bull's eye. Hanks is good, but seriously, Jason Robards  was better. Katherine Graham is portrayed as weak and having difficulty making decisions, someone who was once called, ""the world's most powerful woman."" There are themes such as ""the press vs the President"" that relate to modern times as well as showing the close relationship of government to the press as being unhealthy for democracy.There was an ""F"" word but I don't recall the protest phrase ""We don't want your stinking war.""  Not the adjective I used. The film does a lousy job at introducing people. I knew who they were because I lived through this, but for anyone who doesn't know publishers, owners, reporters, and cabinet officials of the era, might be lost.I read ""The Pentagon Papers"" and the whole aspect of the government lying about a war, I did not find amazing. What I did find interesting was that Ho Chi Minh had written 2 US Presidents (Wilson and Truman). He wanted to be an ally of the US, loved our democratic institutions and requested help to free them from the French.

"The Post","The Papers","Brian Morgan","Steven Spielberg's latest film is a bit of a disappointment.  It regards the release of the Pentagon Papers, which exposed the government's pointless elongation of the Vietnam War.  The story, inherently fascinating, moves well, but is surprisingly compromised by the performances of the two stars, Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks.Miss Streep is, quite possibly, the greatest actress in American history, and part of her attraction is a certain theatricality in her cinematic work.  Here, however, her performance as Katherine Graham, publisher of The Washington Post, seems suppressed.  It is true that part of the point of the film is to show Mrs Graham transform herself from socialite to an active publisher rather than a figurehead, but accounts maintain that Mrs Graham was always a formidable woman.  Here, however, she is as bland as a housewife from the Midwest.  And her transformation fails to ignite the screen.  Did Spielberg, in his first collaboration with the great actress, have an inhibiting effect?Mr Hanks, one of the most likable of movie stars, usually plays--unlike Miss Streep--a version of himself, in the American fashion.  Here, he tries to imitate the real-life Ben Bradlee, but achieves instead somewhat of a caricature.  Jason Robards is much preferable as the same character, in the film version of ""All the President's Men"" (1976).The rest of the ensemble are fine, and it is a delight to have Judith Martin (the future ""Miss Manners"") as a character, excellently portrayed by the stage actress Jessie Mueller.  It was also highly enjoyable to experience a newsroom of the era, an era now sadly past.  Otherwise, the insubstantial film evaporates like morning mist.","3.0 "

"The Post","A Big-Budget Civics Lesson","Carl Schultz","Sometimes there seem to be two Steven Spielbergs.One Steven Spielberg directs pictures which become cinematic legends—pictures like “Jaws,” “E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial,” and the Indiana Jones series.  Those pictures become so phenomenally successful at the box office that they almost instantly enter the global pop culture lexicon.The other Steven Spielberg makes smaller and more cerebral films which seek to examine events or personalities that contributed to changes of moral direction in our society.  Those pictures include “Schindler’s List,” “Amistad,” “Lincoln,” and “Bridge of Spies.”Both Spielbergs seem to be at work in “The Post,” the new drama released into limited circulation in a few major cities shortly before Christmas, but now opening into a wider release across the United States, into some 2819 theaters.“The Post” depicts the discovery and eventual publication in 1971 of the Pentagon Papers, a history of the US involvement in Vietnam between 1945 and 1967 originally produced by the Department of Defense.  The Pentagon Papers revealed the actual political intentions behind the United States’ involvement in Vietnam—that the government had systematically misled both Congress and the American people about the scope, and the nature, of the US commitment to that unpopular war.In Spielberg’s best and most popular movies, the central character often exhibits a tragic flaw, a weakness which makes the character vulnerable to forces outside his or her control:  The police chief in “Jaws” is afraid of the ocean, and Indiana Jones is famously terrified of snakes.In “The Post,” the central character, Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, is depicted as being intimidated in a profession dominated by men.  As played by actress Meryl Streep, Graham needs to overcome her initial insecurities and find the confidence and resolve to face prosecution and possible imprisonment for espionage, as well as the wrath of the Nixon presidential administration, if she decides to publish the Pentagon documents.Streep contributes to “The Post” a balanced and well-nuanced characterization of a woman during a time of enormous social change.  Streep’s Graham is comfortable and commanding in a social atmosphere, presiding over Washington’s power elite during birthday celebrations and cocktail receptions, but conversely terrified to the point of silence during board meetings and editorial conferences.  In a movie about the freedom of the press, Streep is addressing the evolution of women in American society.Tom Hanks on the other hand faces the daunting challenge of portraying a character which already bears the indelible imprint of another actor:  Jason Robards won an Academy Award for what many critics believe to be the definitive portrayal of Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee, in the 1976 political thriller “All the President’s Men.”In “The Post,” Hanks sometimes seems to be channeling Robards as much as he’s impersonating Bradlee—an amiable pirate and seasoned Smilin’ Jack of the newsroom, with a caustic laugh and a harsh cigarette-strained voice rasping out orders from the corner of his mouth.  The viewer never quite forgets that it’s Tom Hanks playing the hard-driving newspaper editor, paying lip-service to the First Amendment and the American Way but also as concerned about getting a scoop as Walter Burns in any high school production of “The Front Page.”The Spielberg picture has been criticized in some quarters, including The New York Times, as being “great cinema, but poor history.”  Specifically, sources within The New York Times have stressed not only that their newspaper published the Pentagon Papers first and set the stage for the legal battle between the press and the United States government, but also that the paper won the 1972 Pulitzer Prize in Public Service for their work.“The Post” acknowledges the courageous and groundbreaking reporting of Neil Sheehan and The New York Times but pointedly does not emphasize it, leading some to the opinion that the role of the Washington Post is exaggerated in the picture.Still, “The Post” is compelling drama, effective in describing aspects of a challenging time in American history…one with obvious, and troubling, parallels to the present.  While younger viewers might be perplexed by the obvious absence of such routine modern amenities as cell phones and personal computers, others will be inspired by the courage displayed during that difficult era in protecting rights many Americans didn’t even know were being challenged.","3.0 "
"The Post","2.5 stars... ATPM-lite journalism drama done strictly by the numbers","Paul Allaer","""The Post"" (2017 release; 116 min.) brings the story of the Pentagon Papers. As the movie opens, we are in ""Vietnam 1966"", showing a mission where the US troops are ambushed and take heavy casualties. A State Department internal reporter takes note of it all. Back in the States, that same guy decides to smuggle out a McNamara-commissioned study about America's decades old involvement in Vietnam. We then go to ""Washington DC 1971"" and we get to know Katherine Graham, owner/publisher of the Washington Post and about to take the company public to secure badly needed cash-flow. Meanwhile, her Executive Editor, Ben Bradlee, is trying to upgrade the paper's reporting. At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from legendary director Steven Spielberg, shot in a hurry in early 2017 when a gap opened in his schedule. The big challenge in a journalism drama like this one is how to keep the audience interested and challenged when the outcome is known beforehand. That is of course what makes ""All The President's Men"" and more recently ""Spotlight"" such fabulous journalism movies. Alas, ""The Post"" (which should be titled ""The Pentagon Papers"" or ""Graham and Bradlee"", as the movie is not really about the Washington Post) falls short on every level against these brilliant movies. ""The Post"" is done strictly by the numbers, and you can see the ""acting"" happening right before your eyes. Nor is there any sense of mystery (as in ATPM) or outrage (as in ""Spotlight""). It all just happens. About the best thing I can say is that Spielberg uses the Nixon White House tapes (remember, the guy secretly taped all conversations) effectively to advance the plot where needed. The 2018 Oscar nominations were announced earlier this week, and how this movie was nominated for Best Picture is absolutely beyond me. Let's call it Hollywood PC at its worst. Likewise for the Best Actress nomination for Meryl Streep, who (in my book) is easily outplayed by Tom Hanks (as Ben Bradlee). So many actresses that would be more deserving of that nomination (I'm looking at you Jessica Chastain!).""The Post"" wend wide a few weeks ago, and based on the lukewarm reception I was hesitant about seeing this, but eventually I gave in (due to a lack of new worthwhile theatrical releases). The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely. The movie played out pretty much exactly as I had expected, not a single surprise in it. A darn shame. If you love a thrilling journalism drama, I'd suggest you reach back to ""All the President's Men"" or ""Spotlight"", and steer away from ""The Post"", an ATMP-lite that falls short, period.","3.0 "

"The Post","A mediocre film that was rushed into production and looks sloppy.","John S Harris","The movie looks like it was made in a hurry (which it was).  And photographically it is a bit disconcerting to watch:  random Dutch angle shots, poor actor blocking within the frame.... the whole thing looks rushed.  It is probably true that this movie was thrown together quickly to capitalize on the rise in anti-media sentiment from certain segments of the government and population.  And it's unfortunate, because this true-life story deserves a better treatment than this movie.OF COURSE Hanks and Streep got Oscar nominations and OF COURSE the movie got a Best Picture nomination.  At this point in their careers it would be considered ""rude"".  Hate to say it, but all they have to do is show up for work and they'll get awards consideration.  It's kind of like the rock band U2 -- they get buzz for Grammy nominations for each new record before the records even get released.  So it's the same with Streep and Hanks.  They may be dependable actors, but that doesn't mean they should be automatically be award contenders by default.  It's idol worship and a bit embarrassing to watch.  Same with Spielberg: all he has to do is make a movie -- ANY movie -- and he'll automatically get awards consideration.  Most filmmakers and actors don't get considered for awards unless they really stand out.  But for Hanks, Streep, and Spielberg, we only DON'T consider them for awards unless the movie really bites or sinks into obscurity rather quickly.  And therein lies the disparity.""The Post"" is a mediocre movie about an important topic.  It's not Oscar worthy, nor did it really deserve its multiple nominations.  Streep and Hanks did good work, sure.  But award-worthy work?  Not really.Rent this if you want, but I cannot recommend buying it.  It's just not worthy of repeat viewings.","3.0 "

But it just plods along, scene after scene, drifting toward....nothing. The final scene is meant to leave the viewer with a sense of anticipation and excitement at the historical implications, but it felt tacked-on and disingenuous. Spielberg seems to have a very naive, apple-pie belief in American ideals that bears no semblance to reality. Skip this Oscar nominee and see I, Tonya instead.","1.0 "
"The Post","Imagining a different past to the one that happened.","Mark bennett","Last year a television producer explained that it was better to explain the past *as it should have been* than to have any commitment to actual history. That re-imagining the past was not really any different than imagining a future. This film (The Post) is very much in that tradition. It takes real historical events, real people and re-imagines them to create a cliche-filled story full of characters that are nothing like the people they were based on.This is nominally a film about the ""pentagon papers"". But rather than being about the New York Times (which broke the story) or the actual events around the case, this film is about the Washington Post, Katherine Graham and Ben Bradlee. The subject of the film is the decision by the Washington Post to publish materials based on the Pentagon Papers during the period when the New York Times was appealing an injunction which ceased their publication of the material. The film blows what amounts to a footnote in history into the center of the drama. Worse yet, it treats the decision to be the *second* newspaper to publish the material as if it were a life and death decision. It treats their decision as if they were the first to publish.Its very much a Steven Spielberg movie in the worst sense of the term. It doesn't help that Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep are brought in to play their now-familiar ""stock"" characters. The problem with Hanks these days is that he doesn't play roles or act.....he just kind of plays himself or the ""himself"" that he has created in films over the years. Streep is horribly miscast and doesn't really understand the person she is playing at all. She is also way too old for the part.Often the film becomes less interested in history or journalism than it is in Meryl Streep. They turn her Graham from a serious person who had direct personal connections to just about everyone who mattered at the top of the US into the weak little flower who is being kept down by ""the man"" and grows through the ""pentagon papers"" into a strong woman. As well, they treat the post as if it were a joke of a paper in the early 1970s. They act as if the ""pentagon papers"" are the big break the paper needs to turn itself from the weekday penny saver of Washington into a real newspaper. Again. totally at odds with history.The film also plays fast and loose with time. Naive people can come away thinking that Robert McNamara worked in the Nixon Administration. The film also presents a narrative to suggest that Graham and Bradlee ended their personal relationships with democratic politicians at the time of the Pentagon Papers. That is a very questionable idea. Especially given that Kennedy was dead and that Lyndon Johnson was long gone from office.Then there is the matter of Graham's son. The film acts as if he was a frontline private in terrible danger in Vietnam. Donald Graham was, in fact, an ""information specialist"" in the military.As to the ""Pentagon Papers"" themselves, they have always been something that people talked about in the abstract rather than really understood. For obscure reasons, Robert McNamara in 1967 ordered a team of 36 people to write a history of US-Vietnam relations from 1945-1967 in secret. The project was kept secret from everyone aside from a small circle within the defense department and existing historians within the defense department were excluded. The greatest mystery of the Pentagon Papers is why exactly Robert McNamara commissioned them. A pathological liar, McNamara himself never provided a rational answer. The final report was 7000 pages.The report mostly showed the disconnect between the public statements of the government versus its internal calculations. The report also made public the extent of US special forces operations in Laos, Cambodia and North Vietnam over the years. But its coverage of military matters was mostly thirdhand and its views on policy were extremely weighted toward the viewpoint of the department of defense. It also suffered as history because it was simply an analysis of a narrow range of reports and memos. To this day, many people will talk about the importance of the Pentagon Papers, but will often be unable to articulate exactly what about them was important or even new.The Nixon Administration's attempts to suppress what amounted to a bunch of dated material entirely concerned with the actions of previous administrations was an overreaction to say the least. By the time the ""papers"" came out in 1971, the removal of US military forces from Vietnam was reaching its peak. Congressional restrictions on the war in Laos and Cambodia were already in place.The legal cases concerning the right to publish the Pentagon Papers were actually, at least to me, more important than the actual content of the papers. The legal preceidents established were all for the good.The problem with films like this is that they are so attached to creating a ""contemporary"" narrative that they end up creating what is some sense false history. ""All the Money in the World"", recently released, had similar problems. We need to ask ourselves why it is that a real dramatic historical event like the Pentagon Papers isn't something that a film can be built around. To ask why a film requires changing everything up.","1.0 "
"The Post","Disappointing","Jodepi","Falls irritatingly short. A botched attempt by Spielberg to make his own version of 'All the President's Men'. Spielberg infuses a women's rights, sub narrative into a very captivating storyline, which would have been fine if it wast thrown it in your grill at every turn. That sub narrative is overstated to the point of exaggeration, and it quickly dumbs-down what could have been a captivating plot. Streep's performance as 'Kay' Graham, the Washington Post owner during the Watergate break-in, is quite maddening. Was the woman such a dolt in real life, or is Streep playing the typical 'deer-in-headlights' character persona we've seen in so many of her performances - as a way to exaggerate Graham's subservient nature around powerful men?  The final scene at the end when Streep (Graham) makes her way down the courthouse stairs with all the doting, admiring  women on either side of her.... Absurdly unrealistic. The 'dumb' meter on my phone was redlining. Tom Hanks as Ben Bradley?  Not impressed with the performance. His attempt at mimicking Bradley's mannerisms and gruff, nicotine-laden tirades seemed forced and unnatural. Bottom line, Hanks isn't very interesting or convincing.In short, The Post doesn't hold a candle to the plot and performances in All the President's Men. Not even the match to light it.","2.0 "

"The Post","Amazing How a Lie Can Be So Truthful!","Trevor's View on Hollywood","One time in high school, a student in my class sent me an article on the declining chocolate in chocolate mines, signaling the eventual end of chocolate. As you figured, he proudly wanted to give me an example of a fake news article since our class at the time was focused on said topic. Now, aligned against such relevant topics, Steven Spielberg initiates his masterful silent storytelling skills once again alongside his ability to grip the viewer right away as he elucidates the US Government’s pinnacle point in The Post.First, a little trivia: did you know the name “Spielberg” is Hebrew for “play city?” Actually, no; it is a German-Austrian name for “play mountain,” inspiring his first film production company, “Playmount Productions.” If I didn’t tell the truth, you would’ve believed my fake news. In the same way, the script by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer (Spotlight) allows each character a chance to distinguish reality based on the given resources. The narrative format here complements the piece, starting off with a gritty, desaturated look of soldiers in Vietnam that suddenly turns into a dark bullet storm in the misty rainforest. After this tense first scene, terrific efforts come out by every player involved, big or small, a proper amount of time given on each to shine in their talent.Although, Spielberg’s hard efforts ultimately lead to a bland inconsistency. The promising style established in the first scene, including the incorporation of old news footage and old movie posters such as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, later gets abandoned. Consequently, the dialogue builds up forced unemotional moments until a cringeworthy so-called-emotional monologue by Meryl Streep shuts off most viewers.Only three women carry significant roles, one a useless, pathetic wife who encourages her husband, one an employee in the Washington Post who barely contributes anything important, and the main female lead, reporter Katharine Graham, who falls along the line of a notion for women overcoming the impossible rather than a plausible human. If instead told from the perspective of Katharine Graham’s partner, Ben Bradlee, then the script might have been able to spot precisely which political agenda to focus on, rather than attempting to cover everything that causes Twitter to crash.Yes, Barack Obama’s lies about the doubling fuel efficiency were horrible, but guess what’s equally horrible? When a recreated historical DC moment in a period of Civil Rights and a War in Vietnam leaves out non-White people. Why ignore the perspectives of Blacks and the Vietnamese? They matter too! Beside the cultural impacts it glazes past, this ordinary Oscar bait ends up #FakeNews, exactly contradictory to its supposed attempts!The Post concocts several false facts, proving its small level of care toward fake news compared against its reliance on a relevant issue to gain sympathy attention. Instead of acknowledging how The New York Times actually published the story before the Washington Post, the narrative points pull a Fox News mindset by an exclusive cafeteria selection process to pick which accurate events will best complete the dramatic story they think would interest above the truth.Of all history’s Best Picture nominees, Amblin Entertainment’s godlike depiction of the Washington Post trumps in its hypocrisy over the rest—even the Washington Post itself lied before: look at its story on Russian hacking the power grid. These Democratic filmmakers intend to brainwash you into thinking the people deserve the ultimate power, except they should not worship themselves if they rely on inanimate print and ink.On the other hand, we must understand Spielberg’s warning signs of the ugly head of fakeness: in the news, on your prescription medications, and amongst your friendships. The flaws cut deeper knowing our current president has told six times more falsehoods in his first ten months in office than Obama told throughout his entire presidency. Thus, The Post causes us to ponder the realities: Government today must say no to fake news.I admit I too pick often the daily highlights to share on Instagram. Just a few weeks ago, a green element parked right in front of my own green element; I had to decide whether it deserved a spot on my Instagram feed: does it fit my selective online identity? Such tiny moments turn us into modes of selective identity, much like The Post’s selective identity that the Washington Post saved America. Chiefly: truthfulness starts with the choices you make.","3.0 "
"The Post","Agenda overshadows a good story","MB","Painful.  That sums up my review in a word, because the movie is painful to watch.  Meryl Streep's character is so cliche that you see her character development from a mile away.  Spoiler alert she is a woman slapped around by men when suddenly at the climax of the movie puts on her big girl pants and starts slapping around the men and is a icon women immediatly began worshipping.  It's such forced imagry that you just shake your head at how low hollywood has sunk.  As a guy who has no horse in the race with politics etc... when it is forced... it just overshadows the movie.  Speilberg, streep, and Hanks... I just feel bad for them.  Do they think this is changing hearts and minds?  My wife commented on the way out, ""so guys watching this film are going to go home and watch a bondage scene on their favorite smut website and somehow we resprect women more in society?""  I thought that hit the mark.  This film is lip service and the modern agenda overshadows what could have been a good film. Watch ""All the Presidents Men"" or even Forrest Gump for a better movie about the time period... unless you are a rabid femenist with an extra bra and lighter... then go and enjoy!","1.0 "

"The Mummy (2017)","What did I just watch?","tobedesiree","It took me roughly five times of watching this movie to get all the way through it. I fell asleep every time that I watched it. At the exact same spot. The beginning of this movie is a very very slow start (hence the falling asleep). After the first 45 minutes, it's like they threw all the monsters they wanted, an actor who is known for comedy, a mummy that's supposed to be sexy, and randomly Dr Hyde? Huh? Add to the mix some interesting choices for the leads, who aren't really known in the horror movie industry and this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen. Maybe Universal should rethink the whole Dark Universe concept and focus on getting a better script for this. Seemed overly cliche and haphazardly put together.Sorry if you liked it, but I definitely won't be watching this movie again.","1.0 "

No character development and a pathetic theme steal from the 1981 American Warewolf In London, if you've seen that movie you'll immediately understand what I mean. (insert major eyeroll here) I mean come on, yeah I've seen worse but Cruise usually delivers. His performance is so annoying and the Jenny (I think that's the blond's name, so forgettable I barely remember) character is obnoxious. This movie is chock full off horror classic steals for what stupid purpose I have no clue because it certainly gives no relevance to the ""society"" since it's never fully explored albeit visual snippets. The mummy character fluctuates randomly in and out of character. Overall it's def. not worth buying. Or viewing again. The only scary thing was the ending because it left it open for sequel.

It came across to me as Mission Impossible in the desert. I really think that they should not have put a ""name"" actor in this part or in any of the future ""dark universe"" movies, if there will be any.

"The Mummy (2017)","Terrible movie (review with spoilers)","Cable","So I watched The Mummy starring Tom Cruise and here are my thoughts about it. There ARE SPOILERS AHEAD!Yes it is pretty bad. It felt rushed, underdeveloped and seemed more like they were trying to paint over past versions of the mummy rather than develop a logical reboot it for their ‘dark universe’ movie plan. I like the idea of universal bringing their monsters into the modern age but they HAVE to make the stories worth it every step of the way and not rush them. This move felt like the first Thor movie. A rushed, by the book, short attention span friendly, joke of a movie they pushed out fast to get it out before the big avengers movie.  The mummy had no character development, poor story development and some predictable characters like his goofy sidekick/friend and his ‘love’ interest.Here are some glaring issues I had with the story.MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD!In the beginning they tell of Ahmanet’s turn to evil. Once she kills who she has to she gets caught and isburied alive as punishment, now this is an issue I had with the other mummy movies as well, why not, oh I don’t know, cut them up and burn them? no, no they simply bury them and curse them with…..being an all-powerful god-like being once dug up. Sounds more like a waiting game to me and less a punishment like kicking the can down the road. Either way it is a MASSIVE story flaw imo.Also near the beginning of the movie we are taken back to merry ol’ England 1127 a.d. to witness knights burying the stone with a fallen comrade. ?????? they know what it is why not just crush it?.....nope, Instead they burry it? Knowing what evil it can bring about they decide, “hey, let’s burry it”  ?????  Another GLARING flaw in the movie. After discovering Ahmanet’s tomb  spiders swarm out of nowhere, freak out tom’s goofy friend, then one and only one spider bites him after which, for no reason, they all leave……why?That spider bite turns the goofy friend into a zombie/ slave……how, why? There was no set up for it to explain it. Couldn’t the mummy have just sent them out into the town to turn them all into slaves and free her? Poor idea and poor execution with that plot point.The character Jenny Halsey (the love interest) seemed stolen right out of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. She is working with the secret society for her own interests. Blah, blah, blah.After discovering the tomb: There is a weight, chain and pulley system hooked up to Ahmanet’s sarcophagus which is submerged in a pool of mercury and Jenny Halsey (tom cruises’ love interest) states it was designed to keep her sarcophagus down. Down?.... A pulley system is all about raising things UP is not keeping them DOWN. A few minutes later Tom Cruise demonstrates this by cutting a single rope in the system after which the whole pulley system…RAISES UP THE SARCOPHAGUS.After the sarcophagus is raised up, the military waiting top-side radio’s down that they have bogies inbound and have to leave NOW. Of course Jenny Halsey won’t leave w/out the sarcophagus. The next scene we see them all evacuating with a helicopter carrying the sarcophagus in a harness. That’s a good 1-2 hours work IF they had all the equipment they needed.  Bogies incoming?? Were they a full day out??There was absolutely no, NO development of tom cruise and Jenny Halsey’s love for each other. They were adversarial in the beginning and somehow were, by mid-movie, in love each other. It just sort of happens and there was a glaring hole where the development of their love story should have been.In the end the mummy is defeated, drained of life by tom who takes on the mummy-ish persona. Poor Ahmanet is a shriveled skeleton of a person now so what does the secret society do? Well, they don’t cut her up and burn her…nope, they put her back in her sarcophagus and lock it up again…. *sigh*The movie is FULL of even more God awful story flaws like the ones listed here and they are obvious as heck. What is it with movies these days? They seem to have such massive story and plot issues and tell their story as if aimed at an attention span deficit audience that they figure won’t notice the horrendously poor writing.  Rotten tomatoes gave this one star and even that was generous imo. One other thing struck me as odd until the end of the movie. This movie doesn’t seem, in any way, like one Tome cruise would do. I remember seeing commercials for it and it just seemed weird for HIM to be doing this movie….until the end. Tom is the mummy now so, going forward, it will be all about him kind’a like what he did with the Mission Impossible movies. They went from a team based TV show to a movie series focused on tom cruise so I expect the same will be done here with the mummy franchise. A smart business move but idk if it is something audiences will buy into in the long run.Some here say it’s worth watching once I recommend waiting for it to be on cable.","2.0 "

Sofia Boutella looked amazing and her movements and makeup were he only reason I could point to to see this film.  She was wasted, however, by a ridiculous script and one of the least appealing and lame Tom Cruise characters I've ever seen.  The story was so one dimensional and pointless and the random action somehow managed to become boring. I wanted to like it.  But I never felt any tension or caring for any character.  DC is going to have to really go re-watch Wonder Woman and take notes if it wants to make its Dark Universe work on film.","2.0 "

This wasn't as bad as I expected it to be, and the story was interesting enough. BUT it was also not nearly epic enough to kick off Universal's Dark Universe. Admittedly, I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, and I think this film would have been better with another main actor. I did enjoy the visuals, and am slightly intrigued by the Dr. Jeckyll/Mr. Hyde plot. I think I would have preferred the film to be set in the original historic context, though (and I feel even more strongly about this with some of the other potential films, particularly Phantom of the Opera, although I'm willing to keep an open mind). I guess more than anything, I'm a bit sad to have such a lackluster film start out what could be a really spectacular cinematic universe. (IMO, the recent Frankenstein film would have been a better debut for the UDU). And for sure, there's no way I will ever watch and enjoy this film as much as I've loved the Brendan Fraser/Rachel Weiss film.","3.0 "
"The Mummy (2017)","It’s a Mission Impossible meets the Immortals… and there’s no “mummy”.","Todd M.","Spoilers… first, the movie is terrible and there’s really no mummy. I remember seeing the Mummy with Boris Karloff when I was a kid and it scarred me because it was a great horror movie but this one is an action movie with literally no scares in it. Second, to be a mummy involves evisceration and mummification and not just wrapping someone up in gauze and burying them alive. Things move slowly in mummy-land but this movie is a runaway action/chase flick that makes no sense and a snarky Tom doesn’t help at all. The Mummy is a horror movie and to do what they did with this one is atrocious and adding a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde wants you to believe that even he can’t die or stay dead like everyone else in the movie. The special effects aren’t even good and if you can believe a tomb is found, entered and a sarcophagus is removed in about 10-minutes then you’re on your way to loving this movie. There are only two women is this and they both want Tom’s body and that’s a real stretch. Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy got a better IMDb score and the mummy was much more believable. There were many times we considered the back button and we regret not doing so.","2.0 "

But, many of us are armchair archeologists and know the traditional names, Amaunet is as good a name as any. Honestly, flipping the story of the last set of Mummy movies from Imotep to Amaunet made Tom Cruise look like the damsel in distress, which is amusing. Paying attention will keep confusion at bay. This could have been better, but it truly could have been worse. The cinematography and some stunning visuals make this flick worth watching.In case you don't know, the Egyptian god of the dead wasn't Set, it was Anubis. Set was the god of chaos.

Tom Cruise couldn't string together two sentences much less get the ""huhs?"" and ""Duhs"" past his vocal cords. The one actor the movie should have spent time developing and deepening was Sophia and the director fell flat doing even that. Out of all the actors, Sophia had the most spark and it was apparent that the director didn't give a damn and totally ignored her chances to strengthen the plot and the movie over all.

I knew this story would have some issues, and it has many, but I hoped that it could overcome them to be a good movie. I was wrong. Universal is trying to duplicate the Marvel Cinematic Universe by using the popular (and copyright free) monsters that have been portrayed a million times. They might not want to make any more movies.The writing is atrocious, the cast is kinda weird, the romance is totally unnecessary, and I was actively rooting for the mummy to win by the end of the movie. Casting Tom Cruise was a odd decision considering that he lacks the subtleties to give his performance depth.

Princess Ahmanet's story mirrored Hatshepsut's story in certain aspects and I love Hatshepsut's story so it felt very realistic but sucked to see it so rushed. This film had no build up and the dialogue between Tom and the blonde female made me cringe every time they spoke to each other. And did we really have a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde character?!There was something so engaging in the past Mummy films that this film just didn't have and something so dominating in the previous Mummies that Ahmanet wasn't written to have.

The attempts at buddy film type banter between Cruise and that guy from the Zoey Deschanel TV show were kind of lame and the comedic timing was off. The whole premise was kind of hokey and then Dr. Jekyll showed up as an overweight gladiator. What? Cruise had a 1-night stand with someone's daughter and then they were soul mates and he couldn't live without her. The double eyeball chick just wasn't that scary.

While this movie did have a lot of action and even some cool scenes and effects I found myself ignoring it and doing other things as I lost interest a lot.

It's not that Tom's acting is bad, but that many of his reactions I have seen in good films before. Perhaps too much saturation of Tom Cruise films for me? It is clear they put top dollars into making this film. High quality effects and beautiful imagery, even in dark scenery. Nice cinematography. Storyline is cheesy when the undead keep returning over and over. Made me think a little bit of LIVE, DIE, REPEAT. If a viewer is unfamiliar with Cruise's work and unfamiliar with Egyptian adventure films then heck this might amaze them. For me I bought it for the 3D and they lived up to nice quality 3D. All the big bucks for this movie and sadly they filmed it in 2D; sorry, but it shows. Why humans think they can create 3D better than a 3D camera I don't understand?

Soundtrack...eh, but not terrible; the “adventure” tracks in it were great but criminally underutilized. Also, this film is NOT a rip-off of the '99 movie, the giant dust-cloud face notwithstanding. That would require it to have more than five minutes of Egypt in it. And the lost city of Hamunaptra. And Medjai. You get the idea.Storyline/Characterization 3/5. This was actually a fairly coherent action/chase film with horror elements, but it suffers somewhat from several issues. It was too short, for one. It needed like another forty minutes to develop properly. Maybe too much chasing, not enough worldbuilding. Trying to balance a Mummy story, an introduction to an anti-monster organization, and a Cruise run-a-thon in less than two hours hurt the thing.I think maybe the modern setting pulled things down a bit because with Internet and cell phones and satellites, there’s not so much mystery/adventure anymore like in previous movies. England isn’t really the best location for this kind of story. There wasn’t enough Egypt or Iraq. Needed more exploring through ancient ruins and stuff, maybe there should have been booby traps and complex catacombs in the tomb. There can never be enough booby traps. Don’t let Indiana Jones hog the concept! The anti-monster guys, “Prodigium”, were an interesting idea but needed more fleshing out, they were a bit too enigmatic and undefined. Like, who funds these people? Bringing Crusaders into the plot overcomplicated things and wasn’t explained well at all.Also, isn’t the Mummy supposed to have more nuance? This isn’t much like the 1932 movie that it’s supposed to be a remake of. It did look like she got possessed by a demon and therefore wasn’t really evil, just needed an exorcism but the narrator was insistent that she was totally bad which is kind of a cop-out. What’s wrong with more complex villains? I wonder why the anti-monster organization didn’t try giving her a shot of the anti-evil serum that Russell Crowe kept sticking himself with. Didn’t she basically have the same issue as he had? Could be a good sequel hook. Either way, she was pretty cool and I felt bad for her ‘cause she got mauled something fierce (getting riddled with harpoons, mercury IV poisoning, etc.) and those clearly hurt, it was a bit discomfiting. Imhotep never got messed up that much back in ’99.Jarring non-ending. Wasn’t this movie supposed to be starting a “monster” version of the Avengers/League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, with five main characters, including both Cruise and the Mummy as protagonists? Seems like a good idea (Marvel Avengers bores me), so why not follow through with exactly that? Anyway, this played out in a really awkward cheesy fashion what with Cruise riding into the sunset like it’s the ’99 version and it just fell on its face in the last five minutes. It’s like they couldn’t decide whether to create a stand-alone movie, or a series starter, and kind of spun around in a circle instead. It ended without any real closure.Acting/Casting 5/5. Everyone’s acting in this was very good. Tom Cruise was not too old for this part; he runs like a madman in a marathon, good stunts too, this was some of his better work of late. Sofia Boutella gave an impressive performance, very atmospheric. Solid work by Russell Crowe (didn’t care for Jekyll, but his Mr. Hyde persona was amusing). Annabelle Wallis was fairly competent also.Universal/Tom Cruise factor ??/5. According to an article in Variety, Cruise and his people took over this movie and gave his character more of the screen time. He apparently had near-total control over rewriting, directing, and editing. With Universal’s blessing, no less! How strange.Gun Battles 1/5. The first two Fraser movies had some sweet shootouts, this film hardly had anything by comparison.Final thought – this could really use a sequel to clear up some of its loose ends, it left a lot of questions unanswered and felt like half a story. It was also a bit too dark/tragic, given my view on the mental condition of the Mummy, so it wasn’t the best ending in that regard. I generally enjoyed the film, though.","4.0 "
"The Mummy (2017)","Bad choice of a Movie..... really bad....","mahon","Actually I did like Cruz in the movie. He was a bit playful, trying to be funny with the other actor and most of the time it worked for me..... BUT the was really bad one. The story was bad, boring and the Mummy woman was a stupid idea. She was really the painful part of the movie. Not just the acting but her part of the story was really bad. Nothing was actually new..... It was more of an Zombie movie. Thats what it was. I hate Zombie movies very tired of them. Always the same thing happens. Stupid idea. I really like Tom Cruz in his movies for he most part, but he chose a stupid one this time. Sorry for this review but I cant believe the people in charge of this whole idea and making of the movie really thought this would be good after its all over.I dont mind watching another Mummy movie but it must be about the Mummy not Zombies. Ok Cruz pick your movies more wisely and lets get an Oscar next time. Pick something to prove to everyone your a great actor not this sick stuff.... thanks","2.0 "
"The Mummy (2017)","Critics Ease Up!","ALP","People are so spoiled and techno-wise about how movies should be made and played. Just enjoy the films for what they are. There was nothing wrong with this film. I enjoyed excitement, (which wasn't over the top) and the absence of a profanity riddled script. Maybe the problem for some people is trying to see Cruise as someone other than Ethan Hunt. There have been mummy movies since Bella Lugosi days and a lot of them not so hot but to me this is a better adaptation thanks to the special effects and the seasoned actors. Don't let the couch critics be kill-joys and just enjoy a nice flick. Every movie is not an Oscar potential or bust occasion.","4.0 "

Cruise is out of his element in this movie. Stick with Jack Reacher and Mission Impossible Tom. This could have been a really good movie with a the right cast. The Mummy movie from 1999 was great. I still watch and enjoy that movie. I could barley finish watching this one because it was so dull and Cruise just didn't fit the part. There were times when he was trying to be funny and fell flat on his face. He was not charming, funny, cute, or even a good action hero. There was absolutely no chemistry between him and Annabelle Wallis either. The story and dialog were very boring too. Even the special effects were just average. And to top it off. They even set this up for a sequel. Hopefully that won't happen. Bad movie.","2.0 "

Roofs and airplanes were involved, that is all I'll say so I don't spoil different scenes in the movie, but I actually found the final movie version of the stunts stupid compared to the making of them.The movie was just corny, really corny.  The very ending was the stupid cherry on the top of stupid.  Just all out goofy, especially with the stars they had in it.

The characters are all very bland and forgettable, the mummy has no real presence or gravitas, and the plot is dull and predictable. I only finished watching this movie because it made decent background noise for other stuff I was doing. This movie really shouldn't exist - the best thing I can say about it is ""it made me want to learn more about mercury and its use in ancient times"". Like I said, not terrible, but that's a pretty low bar.If you want a mummy movie, see the Brendan Fraser vehicle instead; it's campier, but has more impressive visual effects, memorable characters, funny moments, and action sequences you're actually INVESTED in.

"The Mummy (2017)","Ethan Hunt Goes to Egypt","Joseph L. Hennes","Really? I read that Tom Cruise insisted he get more screen time than the mummy; I believe it. This is not a Mummy movie, it is Ethan Hunt goes to Egypt and meets a mummy who sort of inconveniences him before being easily defeated. If Mr. Cruise meant to play someone who was not Ethan Hunt, he failed pretty miserably. I am not one of those folks who hates Tom Cruise simply because he is Tom Cruise. I like a lot of his movies, including his exploits as Ethan Hunt, but if you are going to make a mummy movie, make it a movie about a mummy, not a movie about someoone who found a mummy, and then has this completely unexplained skill set that allows him to defeat the mummy.Ms. Boutella is fine as the mummy, most of her acting was in the stunts. It is hard to make a mummy both sexy and scary, they tried.The movie wasn't awful, there are certainly worse movies out there. If they hadn't tried to tie it to The Mummy franchise, it would have been better. This movie had none of things that made the original great. In the original folks were scared, which you kind of need if you want to scare any of the audience. Tom's character was never even nervous as far as I could tell. Instead of a romance, you get two people who slept together but don't really like each other. I can barely remember that there was a sidekick,and I saw the movie recently. Russel Crowe's character existed solely to set the stage for more movies later, and it was obvious that that was why he was there.If this had simply been a stand alone movie it would have been entertaining.","2.0 "

His acting was particularly bad in this movie. The plot really got confused when Cruise became the Mummy and killed the Mummy only to save the girl that was dead and now she isn't dead. What?!

"The Mummy (2017)","The perfect enjoyment-mode type of movie.","Amazon Customer","I've always enjoyed Tom Cruise, and i loved the Mummy series starring Brendan Fraser (excluding the Dragon Emperor one). But the only thing that Fraser's Mummy and Cruise's Mummy share, is the title. I enjoyed both The Mummy/2 and Tom Cruise's The Mummy, for very different reasons, Partly for the fact that it has Cruise, Russell Crowe, and Annabelle Wallace (who i find drop dead gorgeous, .....besides the point) stare in this film, but mostly it's because of the darker tone they add to this film. The only gripe i have with the movie is that the ending was very bland. But, it leaves room for a chance at a sequel! I don't necessarily care about what some big shot head of lettuce reviewer thinks about this movie, I guessed the plot about 30 minutes in but my brain was already shutting down and going into enjoyment-mode, if you want to enjoy this movie like I did, i suggest you do the same. :)","5.0 "

I LOVE the Brendan Fraser Mummy movies, even the sequels are ok and I was not thrilled when I saw this was labeled as a remake (It’s not). I decided to give it a chance and it’s almost unwatchable. The plot is weird and mixes Egypt, the crusades, and throws in Dr Jekyl and Mr Hyde for some unknown reason. It’s mostly action/horror with bad attempts at comedic relief. Most of the characters are unlikable, especially Tom Cruise. The only reason this doesn’t get one star is because Jake Johnson is actually funny but unfortunately he alone couldn’t save this disaster of a movie. If you want to watch a good action/thriller/romance movie with mummies I suggest skipping this one and going with Brendan Fraser.","2.0 "

This movie could have been 5 Star .Russell Crowe played his part very well.  after the first 15 minutes of stupid joking the movie took off.  I don't want to give any spoilers.  I would have been happy to wait until it was released for awhile instead of paying the $5.99 which my oldest son ordered.  I just haven't seen Tom Cruise take on the roll.

"The Mummy (2017)","Rocky Start for Dark Universe","Justin W. Parente","The Mummy misses the mark in some places, grasping at straws to build a world quickly and ferociously by lying down the groundwork for the mythos that will become Universal's Dark Universe franchise. While I normally like Russell Crowe in whatever he does, Crowe's role as Henry Jekyll/Edward Hyde was short lived and highly unnecessary. Seeing as Jekyll opens the film with a monologue of a sort, I would have appreciated more that he close the film with the revelation that this Dark Universe exists and take the final message ""Some times it takes a monster to fight a monster,"" into the future films. While I genuinely liked the incorporation of Egyptian mythology into this storyline, Cruise's final turn into a god in man's body was such a weak way to go. Seeing that the film took this direction, it's clear Crowe's organization will use Cruise's ""affliction"" to gather the monsters of the DU to help save him (at least, this is my guess).Overall, the movie was good. It had great action, entertaining dialogue, and a good cast. However, comparatively, it feels more like the messy Iron Man 2 to follow the blockbuster that started it all. Except this was their stepping off point. I think the Dark Universe franchise will definitely succeed in future films with their A-List roster of actors that are signed on, but they must also realize they are now trying to compete with the juggernaut of Marvel, the growing DCEU, and now Warner Bros. entry with ""MonsterVerse,"" (Godzilla, Kong, et al).","3.0 "

It's way better plus it has an in-perfect-form Bill Paxton. Much like this review I couldn't keep myself focused on the Mummy. It's just so blah. The best scenes are the few that attempted the more creepy horror type of imagery. They should have stuck with that approach. Instead they went with, I'm not exactly sure actually.

Script and directing poor, and actress playing opposite to Cruise was not very good.

Cruise's attempts at comedy were fair, but obvious - I thought he did a good job, but suffered from poor casting, etc.Anyhow, for a fan of the Mummy movies, looking forward to this new one, I was disappointed - but gave it 3 stars because it was watchable.","3.0 "

The newest Mummy reboot is as dry and lifeless as something dug out of the Egyptian desert. Even Tom Cruise can't charm his way through this one. The last time The Mummy franchise was rebooted in the 90's, they added a camp factor which really helped make the flick enjoyable. This movie took itself way too seriously. There was absolutely zero chemistry between Tom Cruise and Annabelle Wallis, and the supporting cast was also comprised of very poorly written characters, all of whom were instantly forgettable. The  zombie element felt really out of place, and the ""threat"" of the mummy never felt real. I suppose as it gets closer to Halloween if you want something harmless to watch this will work, but if you are looking for a slick reboot of a classic franchise you will be extremely disappointed.","2.0 "

But of course Cruise spends the entire second half of the film demonstrating what a selfless, sacrificial, devoted and loving grave robber he really is -- way down deep inside. SPOILER: He dies not once, but twice, for the woman that he had a quickie one night stand with, and then ditched while she slept. Class act. The movie itself doesn't resemble anything to do with mummy/Egyptian lore that I'm familiar with. Ends up turning into a zombie film of all things. The ending leaves it wide open for a sequel, but after how poorly this film performed at the box office, don't count on it. Cruise took a risk with this genre, and it failed big time. His Scientology cult will bail him out financially if necessary.","2.0 "

It has some good special effects in the film but it doesn’t make up for the broken storyline. Having one of the main characters being Dr Jekyll/ Mr. Hyde was just stupid. There is also a character that is a flashback to the American Werewolf In London film.Overall the film was good in parts but it was just to choppy in its presentation. It could not decide if it was a mummy movie, a zombie movie, a Dr. Jekyll movie or a throwback to the American Werewolf In London film.Like I said, some parts of the film were good and that’s why I gave it 3 stars. The BluRay disc was good and I downloaded a digital version of the film to stream to my devices.

"The Mummy (2017)","Don't let the reviews tell you what to like, decide for yourself.","Pat Pugh","I bought this movie as a gag really, because I'd heard how bad it was.  Both my friend, myself, and the other three in attendance to watch what was supposed to be a ""horrible train wreck of a movie"" ended up pleasantly surprised.  In fact the comments from everyone in attendance was ""apart from the ending, this was actually a fun movie.""  The ending, without spoiling anything, was a bit of a formed ending that was made in order to create that Dark Universe that the film company was going for when trying to create a Marvel-like monster universe of linked films.  Had they not done what DC continues to do with their films and just let the first movie stand on its own, then this movie probably wouldn't have been so panned.  I think.  But I know in a lot of the reviews I read there was a lot of complaints about Tom Cruise trying to be a jerk character and how it doesn't work.  That's not true, it actually works out great.  It starts off a bit like the Uncharted video games, and that's a GREAT thing!  It's fun, and has plenty of action.  The story progressing pretty well, until about half-way through when it comes to a bit of a halt in order for all of the exposition at trying to explain this UNIVERSE that they were trying to setup.  Had it not been for that, and had they just let this movie stand on its own, I truly think it could have started a franchise.  What we have in the end is a fun-enough movie full of some good action and pretty enjoyable effects.  Don't let the reviews tell you what to like, decide for yourself.","3.0 "

It was perfectly entertaining.I will say though that this was more ""Mission Impossible: Supernatural"" than a mummy movie. Perhaps it would have been more well received if it was a stand alone movie not called ""The Mummy"" ... because it hardly took place in Egypt and in fact, the ""mummy"" wasn't even found in Egypt and after that the rest of the movie took place in England.There were some issues with the story for sure (not to mention, Cruise's character was kind of a dick). The ending was kind of dumb and I don't think I fully understood it, but the action scenes were pretty good and it was mildly entertaining.","3.0 "

"The Mummy (2017)","Not a reboot, a ""Look at Me I'm Tom Cruise"" Movie","Retired Nerd","Some good spots, but mostly quite boring, and seemed extended ""scenes of talk"" were downright awefull. I had to fast forward much of that because it was tedious, and seemed to exploit ""HEY Tom Cruise is in this movie"".  I thought it wood be a Mummy Thriller with many parts of intense action, but the sand of London and the Plane was about it. They seemed to try to make it a ""Mummy Meets Indiana Jones meets Legendary Gentleman movie, but failed terribly. The casting of the mummy was really good, but everywhere else, not so good. Like others had said, they made it a Tom Cruise movie, not a Mummy Movie. The writing was not good, and the editing made it move around a lot. It could have been so much more, Sofia Boutella was excellent, but under utilized and given very little good scenes There will be sequels I guess, and I hope the writing is better, and besides Cruise and Sofia Boutella, I hope for a better supporting cast. Also, they said ""reboot"", and it is in no way shape or form similar to the earlier ones of any era.","2.0 "

"The Mummy (2017)","Ridiculous film!","MommaMia","This was a terrible movie...not because it's not ""typical"" Tom Cruise fare...not because there wasn't enough profanity or sexual content...but because it was ridiculous.Tom Cruise is so overrated in my opinion.  Last good film he starred in was Legend!  The concept of the mummy being a woman was where the ridiculousness started...and having ""Dr. Jekyll"" in it as well...took it right over the top.  If this was supposed to be a respectful remake of the original, it failed miserably.  Perhaps that wasn't the intent, but I thought it was.  When they redid The Wolfman, it was a great film and it respected the original.  This just can't hold a candle to the original mummy films.  Yes, changing the sex of the mummy changed the tone of the film.  I have nothing against women being in the forefront in movies...I have no problem with the actress or her performance...I just think it veered too far from the original to be a respectful remake.  Tom Cruise and the whole idea of Dr. Jekyll just blew it for me.","2.0 "

"The Mummy (2017)","To Watch or Not To Watch: THAT is the Question.","ADKhiker","As a fan of the original ""Mummy"" movies, I went into this knowing that it wasn't going to be of the same caliber as the older films. All of the recent films nowadays are too full of action due to the lack of attention spans of our audiences and there is very rarely any depth to them. The movie, as is most movies now, was very predictable and as for the characters, lackluster. The character played by Tom Cruise was ok at best, Russel Crowe did do a very good job, but the character played by Annabelle Wallis completely turned it off for me. That being said, Sofia Boutella gave a wonderful performance as the Mummy, and she saved the movie from being a complete waste of my time. She did a phenomenal job and you could feel her characters' emotions along with her and at least for me, pity her! I would say, if you want to watch it, go into it NOT expecting something similar to the other films in The Mummy franchise, but keep an open mind for the villain at least. I was pleasantly surprised a chunk into the movie.","3.0 "

Other reviews that read (yes even from ""professionals""), ""Of course a younger woman chasing Tom Cruise in one of his movies! typical sexist stuff!"" sorry but I don't see that - people want to be offended over anything nowadays.Finally, reviews the read, ""I hate Tom Cruise he is a freak!"" hate the artist but don't hate the art or entertainment I learned that a long time ago.","4.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","The authors kind of chickened out in this movie","Bill White","NOTE: SPOILERS FOLLOW!! SPOILERS FOLLOW!!Note a bad movie if it was on it's own. A well done horror monster movie with good action and decent acting. The problem is this movie is supposed to be a followup to the previous movie which had alien engineers luring us to their planet and then humans going to investigate some of the BIG questions of humanity.But this movie cheats us as robot kills all the engineers and no big questions are answered. I understand this would have been difficult to do since you need to create semi giant engineers but if Star Trek could do episodes with big and important questions why can't film makers do it today?And if you aren't willing to answer big questions then DON'T ASK THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE.Who are the engineers?Why did they make the monster serum?Why did they leave clues on Earth to lure humans to one of their planets?So although the movie is good as a standalone feature it fails to deliver as part of the alien series.","3.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","This disappointed me. I'm a big fan of the classic ...","Leo B","This disappointed me.  I'm a big fan of the classic alien movies and of Prometheus, but this wasn't like any of the other films at all.  This was more of a story-based movie with a LOT less action than true fans are used to.  Fassbender's acting skills remain absurdly awesome, but he's totally wasted in this movie, as are some of the others.  The story is also a bit weak with several big holes in it.  If you're a true Alien fan you probably feel compelled to watch this to keep up with the franchise.  Do yourself a favor and watch it for free on Netflix or Prime.","2.0 "

I wanted an explanation of the loose ends from Prometheus but this is not the movie I was looking for......I am kind of bummed I bought it. Renting it once would have been plenty. 3 stars is harsh. I should really give it 4 but it's a let down.","3.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","Not good, not bad","James M.","To say this was a groundbreaking entry to the Alien Franchise would be accurate in that it does change the mythos of the entire Saga, That being said, it was Okay. Not good, not bad, just Okay. There were numerous stand out moments that showed the overall potential of this film, but these were counterbalanced by some of the worst story telling moments and editing flubs. Part of the reasons these movies are failing is the audience and our unrealistic expectations. We are never going to get an Alien movie that will have the same impact as Alien and Aliens. They were new and cutting edge. doing things that seemed impossible before the advent of digital effects. Now, we have seen it all before. The point is, if you enjoy the franchise, the Xeno-universe or sci-fi B-horror, you will enjoy this movie. If you expect to have your world shaken by the brilliance of this film, buy something else.","3.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","What the heck did I just watch, 'cause it sure wasn't an Alien movie...","River","I really wanted to like this movie--been waiting five years for it. I watched it in the theater opening night and left with mixed feelings, wondering ""what the heck did I just watch, 'cause it sure wasn't part of the Alien franchise."" Against my better judgement, I thought I would give it another chance. Nope.... still sooo disappointing. Granted one always has to ""suspend belief"" for any movies like the Alien franchise, but this took it to new and stupid depths with people (supposedly scientists, but the jury is still out on that one) making one ridiculous, nonsensical decision after another. Yes, people in horror movies inevitably make stupid decisions or we wouldn't have anything to watch, but this one takes the cake in that category.The main protagonist was too emotional, weak and a poor facsimile of the iconic Ripley--an insult to Ripley's character actually. Shaw would have been a better choice, but the way the dealt with her in this film was disappointing as well. There was little to no chemistry between the characters and even though the movie spent a lot of time setting things up, I couldn't care less about any of them. They were boring, plain and simple. Also, there were several snippets that were released separately from the film before it's premiere that should have been included in the final cut to help explain some of the back story. Not sure who's idea it was to leave them out, but it was a bad call. Even the CGI in most scenes wasn't that great, which was surprising given what they had done with Prometheus.Yes, we wanted to see more of the xenomorph than we did in Prometheus (even though I actually liked Prometheus), but not at the expense of the plot. I think Ridley Scott just phoned this one in and it's a shame as it had potential. Wait for it to hit the bargain bin if your looking to buy to complete your set. It's not worth full price...","2.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","This Alien Not Ready for Prime Time","Jack Heape","Probably the worst of the Alien franchise. I read several of the reviews before renting it and decided to give it a shot. Big disappointment. A lot of the effects were good, but the story line absolutely sucked. Most of the actions taken by the crew makes no sense whatsoever. Not much character development and I never really identified with any of the crew. They just didn't seem real. Many of the events in the script were trite and predictable. I mean come on (spoiler alert), how many times has a ""look alike"" spoof been used where the good twin supposedly survives only to have it turn out that its the bad twin. And I have to disagree with some of the reviewers comments about answering questions. This movie left more questions unanswered in my opinion. And the story arc from the first Alien movie to this one makes even less sense than it did after Prometheus. This movie is worth watching once you can for free but I wouldn't pay for it.","2.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","Great Movie!","Picard","I like the Alien Franchise. And aside from Alien 3, and to a lesser extent Alien: Resurrection. I found all the other movies to be extremely entertaining. Prometheus was incredibly good IMO, Aliens or no.Now this movie was really, really good. I felt genuinely on edge throughout. It did feel like an extended cut was incoming though. Aside form a few characters, I didn't feel a real connection to the people that died. Maybe that is what turned so many people off about this movie. Maybe that it wasn't just a start to finish Michael Bay action movie, who knows? All I know is that the characters they allowed me to get to know I cared about, or hated...It's an Alien movie and a good one at that. The acting is good and the writing was pretty decent too. Could have done a better job in some places, sure, but although annoying, it didn't ruin the experience for me.It's just a really good Alien movie, don't listen to the Michael Bay types, watch this movie!","4.0 "

This movie is about a group of people assigned to find new worlds for a colony to grow when they are signaled to this new strange world and yes you guessed it the Aliens are all over it creating and evolving as they so often do.Michael Fassbender is here again playing a good and bad android who at least is a bigger stretch then the one he played in the last film. His motives are not that big of a stretch to be believe although I think they could have been revealed much fast as this movie tended to just put put a long in some places.It's def not the worst of prequels/sequels I still think it is time to call it a day and end these while the interest is still fairly there.","2.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","Worth a rent. I miss Ripley.","Kevin C","Long time fan, own the first 3. It's worth a watch and, if you don't expect it to surpass Alien 3, you will be okay. It's a solid 3-star movie as a stand alone film. I can see why lots of people give it the 1-star ratings though - disappointed fans who expected too much from big budget hollywood and an old guy who are more interested in making political statements & propaganda than making a good sci-fi horror movie. It's hard to like it when there is no sci-fi and you don't jump in your seat even once. Harry Potter has spookier moments - really.Pros: It's not as bad as the rating on Amazon would suggest. It's on par with Ressurection or Prometheus. It's fun watching all the ignorant fools die horrible deaths. Fassbender does the best job of course. The Alien is back. It's big budget and you can tell. The best pro of all is only two minutes of screen time for James Franco before he dies!Cons: The new female lead ain't no Ripley and her saying ""motherf***er"" just don't sell, good actress but not right for the part, imo. It is pretty predictable, there is some gore but not much movie magic in the scares department. No character developement except for the Android. You don't relaly care about anyone in this movie. Not much of a story really, disappointing.I find it realistic in the sense that, it is totally believable that our commanders really are that inept in the future. In that sense it is totally believable. This is the kind of line officers, and ship build quality, you get when everyone is ""special"" and super PC coporatists run the world. God help us if the best thing we got to fight Alien monsters is a 98-lb woman who just walked out of the beauty parlor and a hobo.

Why cant the on board computer push the button to deploy/retract solar sails when needed?  Why use a humanoid to do that? Why arent the settlers trained properly, in such that when encountering a new planet with new microbes, environment, species, air etc that they dont run around smelling, poking, lazing around etc?  Why even send in humans to scout? Why send the entire on board team to scout???? they are so high tech to build a starcraft yet dont have drones to do space repairs or scout missions?  why only one landing craft for over 2k settlers and gear??

The visuals were good except the various aliens are missing a certain realism to them, like bad CGI or something. The alien of the first two movies more or less were ambush hunters, here they are more stalking hunters. Not that there is anything wrong with that but it does affect how the tension plays out typically for the worse. It wasn't that scary really, and that is part of why this movie is not that good. It lacks any build up of fear, it is just kind of a movie where there a couple  aliens killing people. This is the next problem: the writing. For the love of god, why can't Hollywood write a script that is plausible based on human nature. Some of the decisions made in this movie are mind numbingly stupid, as in I don't care how stupid somebody is, they still would not make those decisions. Without spoilers, the overall purpose for the events revealed in the movie don't make total sense. OK, they happened, but why? I guess they spent 200 million on the effects then hired junior high school students to write the script and story line. Also the characters are not developed here due to time and the number of characters introduced. If they could write a good script they could have given some depth to the characters so you actually care about them. They did that in the first movie why can't they do it here?","2.0 "

This movie's script was so wishy-washy that someone should've tossed it in the trash bin way before it ever got to Ridley Scott.

The movies range from horror, action, to cerebral thrillers (Alien 1, 2, and 3 respectively).  If you were hoping to see space marines blowing stuff up like in Aliens/Alien 2, you will be sadly disappointed.  If you had been paying attention to Alien 3 and Prometheus, then you got what you were expecting.Covenant returns to two familiar themes of the franchise, and unpacks them carefully in an engaging cerebral thriller.  The two themes are the possibility of the xenomorphs as WMD and the morality of the artificial intelligence of the android synthetic life forms.  To better clarify the issues, we are asked to consider the motivations of the creators of both the xenomorphs and the AI--and even that is take a step further.  We are asked to ponder what is the basic philosophical imperative of good and evil.  As a side note, we are also left wondering if humanity itself was an attempt at a weaponized life form created by ""the Engineers"" of Prometheus.I think most of the people who gave this one star wanted to see stuff blown up, and were disappointed to get a deep exploration of morality.","5.0 "

Plot. ...what plot?)• Fast forwarding through the waste of time (...)• Awesome, we're safely back on the ship. Unfortunately, most of our crew members died tragically but hey, lets go get down in the head. Gotta show off that steamy nude death scene. (Zero chemistry between the crew, character development, etc etc etc = zero care or concern for the crew)• Insert ridiculous ending that made me rip the arm rests off my chair and bash my monitor into a thousand pieces. (Genuine disappointment)If you still want to watch the movie, either rent it or wait until it lands in the bargain bin. This movie is suffering from a series of problems that bothered me as I watched it.Did anyone else think the aliens just didn't ""feel"" real? I'm just going to assume whoever handled the CGI was a tad bit lazy during development. I don't know if its just me but i'm just going to say the script was sub par. *Sigh* lets hope the last origin story that ties it in with Alien is going to be a good one.","1.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","Corporations out of control !","Jesse Smith","In this future, corporations are so wealthy that they can afford to legally eliminate the most dim-witted of the species by sending them out on ""colonization missions.""If you watched this film without knowing this meta-plot, then you watched a predictable horror-scify where an inexplicably-stupid crew proceeds to get themselves killed. Yes, there were some nasty aliens to assist, but these dummies could have done it all with nothing more than the coffee machine and a bit more time. Was the solar storm planned or just poor luck?

"Alien: Covenant","Good but not great","Megal","Only one complaint. The younger aliens look like circus monkeys with no hair and long pointy heads. Special effects team really missed it on that one. A couple more continuity problems from scene to scene but I will not mention them so as not to spoil the movie. A couple of scenes were pointless and could have filled the time used with more visual references to the original Alien. All other special effects are worth the movie.

"Alien: Covenant","I love Ridley Scott","Nabucodonosor","I love Ridley Scott. The very first Alien was the very best of the whole series, I think. People often forget that it is Ridley Scott who directed it. Cameron only came second. In any case, Scott is the best, Fassbender is certainly an excellent actor, the photography is (as always with Scott) superb. Truly amazing movie visually. And the sound track is equally magnificent. Unfortunately, the movie evolves too much around Fassbender's character. Overall, the storyline and the script are pretty weak. Zero point for creativity and originality, the plot is difficult to believe, as most of the characters make the worst choices/decisions possible and react very unprofessionally--on such an important mission as travelling through space with thousands of people to build a new colony, you would take rookies as crew members?!?  Well, it's the first time I am disappointed with a movie by Ridley Scott.","2.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","I liked the gore scenes","Eric reed","Ohh how much trouble would have been saved had the crew been able to hit their targets. What's the point of laser sights and automatic weapons if you can't hit something 20 feet away?I liked the gore scenes, they were done really well. They were familiar to the alien franchise, but still unique; kind of showing us different vectors of infection causes different kinds of 'bursters'. I think the shortcoming in this movie was lack of answers. The cast was very good, the gore scenes were really well done, but the backstory of the engineers was absent. Also, the exact fallout of David and Elizabeth from Prometheus was pretty poorly explained and fell painfully flat. And lastly, my only criticism of a character in this movie is David's character. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll try to be as vague but clear. David's character just seems to not make sense. He does things when no one is watching that contradict his motives, and since no one is watching him, it's like, who is he trying to fool? Is he being genuine? Why is he behaving this way privately when his actions directly contradict this behavior?It's a good-ish movie. I would watch parts of it again because of the gore and I also really dig some of the music when the aliens are in the scenes. They use the same tune nearly every time to queue the alien, but it fits and I like it.","3.0 "

When some of the crew take a shuttle to the planet, a husband laughs and tells one of the male crew. over the radio,  ""and, keep your hands off my wife"".  WTF? Really?  Ok....If you're going to make that joke, have some hanky panky going on in the crew...or a running gag between the two guys...Oh, and it's better to joke BEFORE a crew mate dies in a horrific accident and you go down to a strange and frightening planet.

"Alien: Covenant","terrible. It's full of inconsistencies","Dave","This movie was, in a word, terrible.  It's full of inconsistencies, dull characters, long periods of nothing much happening, and it doesn't really move the alien series forward at all; it's like an attempted remake of ""Aliens"" most of the time, but where you replace memorable characters like Ripley, struggling to overcome her nightmares from the first encounter, Hudson, the ""surfer dude"" marine, Hicks, even the semi-contemptible Gorman,all memorable characters, with... well, one guy wore a cowboy hat and one was some kind of religious fanatic (which seemed like it was somehow supposed to be significant but mostly was just whining about why people didn't like him).  Other than that they were just a bunch of spear carriers for the aliens to off.  The android duo seemed like an excuse for quoting Byron.  And then… so, spoilers involved in this part:Dr. Shaw is singing a 20th century country western tune?  What?  When did she turn into a cowgirl?And… one would assume David has been sending out the signal to attract some human ship that could then be used to deliver his cabinet of monstrosities to human space to rid himself of the pesky meat bags that created him.  And a country tune is a perfect distress signal because?This system is, let us say, at least one AU from the ship.  And the signal could only be picked up by a tiny little antenna in a space suit helmet because the guy wearing it was “so far out” that it was, like, a few hundred feet closer, while the communication systems in the ship were incapable of picking it up?The pathogen is somehow converted from bomb canisters into mushrooms?David flies the ship to the baldy alien homeworld (which has a single city on it… what?) doing a perfect synchronized swimming maneuver with the docking station, drops the bombs… and crashes the ship into the top of a mountain?  Huh?“This is wheat.  I know wheat.”  What was that supposed to mean?  That the bald aliens seeded earth with humans and wheat crops?  That David likes toasted oats so he planted some and it spread like weeds?  That wheat, like the mice in “Hitchhikers,” is the real supreme race in the galaxy?  Or is it just a way to make the movie last 20 seconds longer?The pathogen makes ichy aliens pop out of people (which flies directly in the face of Prometheus, but at least David says “sometimes the host mutates, sometimes it spawns a creature,” so I guess the folks in Prometheus were just lucky).  Ok.  So, ten years later, why haven’t the bodies of the creature-spawning pathogen ingesting population rotted away?  Instead it looks like someone excavated Pompeii.I remember when Ripley sees all the colonists have been impregnated by face huggers, she says “where did all the eggs come from?”  Which was a setup for the eventual boss monster fight with the alien queen.  So, with David’s genetically engineered super-aliens (although, quite frankly, a pathogen that turns into tiny wisps of smoke, flies around where ever it wants, can insert itself into the bloodstream at will, and spawns a human sized critter from a person half an hour later seems a little more uber than the facehugger/alien combo David’s come up with).  But, the point is… where did the eggs come from here?Where did the second alien that ended up on the ship come from?And really, what was the point of that entire sequence?  It seemed like an attempt to recreate the Ripely/Queen boss fight in Aliens, except it wasn’t a boss, and it didn’t have the creativity (and foreshadowing) of the cargo loader exoskeleton (I knew in the Aliens film that that had to come in at some point later in the movie, because they spent enough time on it I knew it had to mean something… unlike, as it turns out, “I know wheat.”)The ship’s control room catches on fire in the first part of the movie, but when David takes over, it’s completely pristine again?David pops little facehugger embryos out of his mouth and sticks them in with the human ones at the end of the movie.  What happened to the eggs?  Can you just plan a facehugger embryo in a human, and it works the same as having a facehugger face hug you?  Or do you hatch them from humans so they can face hug another human and create an alien?  Inquiring minds want to know.All in all, the sets were awesome but it doesn’t make up for a confused, inconsistent story line, dull characters, and ignoring the entire Alien backstory.  Thumbs way down on this one.","1.0 "

Many of the questions raised by ""Prometheus"" are answered, but it's done in a very indirect manner. These elements save the film from a mediocre story that begins with several rather questionable decisions (read: typical horror movie idiocy). It's not a great film, but I can appreciate what I think Scott was trying to do. That's why I give it 4 stars instead of 3.","4.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","In Ridley Scott's Universe, Humanity Is Too Dumb To Live","Troy Riser","Three stars for Michael Fassbender's performance. Every other aspect of this movie drops a star, along with another just for Ridley Scott.Here's the thing: I'm an ordinary guy who has been lucky enough to meet and know a number of truly extraordinary people who have done extraordinary things: fighter pilots, war heroes, police detectives--the kind of people who comprise an elite and very select professional class. One of the many things that stands out about such people is their amazing calm; that is, their absolute cool under the most trying and stressful circumstances. Part of it is due to training, of course, but part of it is also a matter of temperament, the way they are. The reason these people attain their respective positions is largely because of that calm. They almost always go through a rigorous selection process which is essentially a way to determine if they are capable enough to exercise sound judgement in the most chaotic and dangerous situations.So here we are in Ridley Scott's universe, where the (presumably) highly trained and motivated officers and crew members responsible for a multi-bazillion dollar vessel and its 4,000+ sleeping colonists are incredibly, impossibly, unfailingly incompetent throughout the course of the entire movie. After about an hour of watching these inept buffoons bumble and stumble their way from one disastrous situation to another, violating rudimentary safety protocols, bungling the simplest judgement calls, and doing it all without any semblance of order or discipline, I was ready to sign up for Team David. Humanity, it seems, is just too stupid to live.I mean, come on:  space exploration entails surviving in the most hostile environment there could literally possibly be. In any hypothetical scenario, the people entrusted with the running of the ship and the care of the colonists would--by necessity--be trained to the utmost, carefully screened, put through any number of weeding-out processes to ensure only the very best would hold this responsibility.A character says--after an attack by monstrous carnivorous aliens--""Hey boss, I'm going to go wash up."" Does the captain say, ""No, splitting up in an unknown and quite probably hostile environment is a bad idea. We'll wash up in pairs with one standing watch""?  Oh no, not in this reality. In this incredibly screwed-up Bizarro world, the captain replies, ""Don't go far.""Geez Louise. Are you kidding me? Really? Don't even get me started on the couple-in-the-shower scene or the classic 'Hey, I think I'll follow David into that dark tunnel with the museum of horrors down there--and I'll do it alone because...wait, what?'Human beings don't act this way. To the point, highly trained and motivated leaders and professionals don't act this way. They simply don't.For a movie to work, the viewer must buy into the logic of the film, whatever the genre: fantasy, drama, space opera or horror flick. This movie didn't work--not for me, anyway. I'm thinking maybe it's time to put this franchise to rest. I'm thinking I'm not alone in feeling this way.","3.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","Unfortunately this could have been a good movie but it just kind of got lost","Mick","Unfortunately this could have been a good movie but it just kind of got lost. What was good about Alien was the creature and the terrifying process of being infected, but just having people wander off stupidly by themselves to get killed was boring.  Aliens came close but they had to wipe out most of the Marines and equipment to give the Aliens a fighting chance. This movie at least had the Aliens demonstrating the capability of wiping out superior numbers of heavily armed personnel. Instead of going with this strength the movie introduced the alien plague which wipes out all planetary life and causes aliens to burst out of their host. They wiped out all the creator race who were built up in the previous movie but now stupid as humans at a political rally and more like neanderthals. I was kind of hoping they were going to give the predator guys a bit of a run for their money. However crazy androids deem plague alien spawn to be inferior to from the egg face hugger aliens which unfortunately don't have anyone left on the planet to get multiplying -- at least until unsuspecting colony ships arrive -- if they don't all accidentally infect themselves the wrong way first. And it doesn't help that the movie is tediously slow in the usual immature Hollywood character development and super accelerated where the alien is concerned.  It bursts out of someone a foot high, kills someone, then runs off into the bushes. In 5 minutes it is back three foot high to kills someone else and when it shows up 30 minutes later is full grown. It is as though the director is like I have to appeal the masses with gore so I will just go over the top with that and apply no thought in having it make any sense so I can pursue my artsy thoughts which change like the wind. Make your alien movies to be good and fund as many movies as you would like to make for art film festivals later.","2.0 "

We've all seen enough of that, and it debases our society to keep indulging in these mindless excuses for entertainment. Specific to this film, what we should be assuming is a highly trained, professional crew entrusted with an advanced space-faring vessel capable of interstellar travel... bumbles through the plot with an unaccountable bush-league dimwittedness.Compared to the original Alien franchise classics, Covenant utterly fails to capture the novelty, character, and true SciFi horror of the first movies, and does little or nothing to add to the story line. Of course, the special effects and cinematography are outstanding, and the scenes of space and planetary vistas constitute the only reason to sit through the movie. As always though, the visual facade cannot disguise the failings of an uninspired plot and weak characters.","1.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","Haters don't own Alien, Ridley Scott does! Enjoy it!","Jon Mark","Let's get this straight. The Alien franchise is nothing more than a series of monster movies. Monster movies that one should never forget, are credited to Ridley Scott as the originator ]. In fact, the franchise belongs to him and haters need to check themselves when they come to criticise these movies. It should also be pointed out that the new generation of haters was raised and bred off of the haterade that was being passed around when David Fincher made his Alien movie ]. The hate is further instigated by people like Neill Blomkamp who stirred the pot again when he tapped into that hater sentiment to ignore the rest of the Alien series by extending the story from Cameron's Aliens Special Edition.I mean, it's not as if Ridley Scott is winning awards with all of his other movies but then, when he spits out another Alien picture, he suddenly forgets his craft? No, the criticism is subjective and now, without merit. Alien: Covenant is dark and twisted, a new and much different approach to the formula we've seen from the other films. David is far sinister than we've expected synthetics to be from the other films where they have to redeem themselves somehow. Not here, man! The Alien (McGuffin) is just the placeholder to take us through the story as we see characters we could more or less care about become Alien chum.  As a creature-feature, it does what it's supposed to do and it does it as well as it's going to.Are the characters interesting? Not really. We don't really know all of them and tend to forget which ones are getting killed off. Are they making stupid decisions? Sure they are! How else are we going to get to graphic blood splatter!? The albino alien is certainly a new aesthetic added to the series as it stands before David like a faceless corpse, what I thought was a rather disturbing scene. If you're willing to accept that this is just another monster film and can suspend your criticism for two hours, then you'll have a good time. What more do you want?We've got one more of these pictures coming and with Ridley Scott being nominated for best director of a recently troubled film, he's going to without a doubt, get that Alien movie made with full studio support. The haters could only wish that Scott doesn't wake up or takes a fatal slip in the tub. But they're always going to be there to attack the Alien series, claiming to be such purists. Viewers should always remember, however, that unless Cameron returns to the Alien series, this thing doesn't belong to him or even us as viewers, it belongs to Scott!","4.0 "

Other reviews cover these defects in detail, so I won't belabor them here.Ridley Scott has suggested that he has another couple of Alien movies in the offing.  Before returning to the studio, he should hire good script doctors to ensure the plot and characters hold up better.  Science fiction is a demanding genre with fans who will rip a mediocre movie to shreds.  Unlike horror genre fans, sci fi fans despise unintelligent, clueless protagonists who commit foolish errors.

"Alien: Covenant","Awful. Scott, You Once Had Something Great","Lucas","I was going to write this in response to someone asking why this movie is getting such bad ratings, but it got a little extensive and I didn't want to seem like I was hounding that reviewer. Here it goes: Because it was awful compared to the originals that sparked it. There was no substance, no suspense. The characters do nothing relatively scientific or as they are a million miles from earth even though they are supposed to be a spacecraft crew. They act like idiots throughout the whole movie. Two get sick with an unknown ailment so they run towards the ship..... Ummm, there's no quarantine policy?  This is space and there's nothing out there. It's just you, your crew and you're one false step from dying and killing an entire load of colonists. That's what I liked about the original Alien and Aliens movies. They acted like they were in space. Not like they were strolling around in a city greenblelt. There was science to the science fiction. When they went into space, they were methodical and careful. They acted professionally. These characters acted like they were run on emotion. A space crew wouldn't crack like that. Think if an airline pilot acted like that. Well, this is 100 times more serious than piloting an airline if it were real. They just kept running around making stupid mistakes to make writing the movie and directing it less work for the writer and director out of pure laziness and lack of content. Like when they are outside of the ship doing repairs. There was a whole lot of, ""Yeah, just floating around out here. Easy deal. Noting to worry about."" It lacked any realism whatsoever. You can't just assume your special effects are going to float the movie. You have to have memorable scenes do that. Also interesting dialogue, interesting characters, good humor. There wasn't a single memorable scene in the movie, yet I can pick 10 from the 1st two Alien movies at ease....even the 3rd has a couple. Then there were just random bad comments all over the movie. Like when David leads them to the city and the lead woman character just blurts out, ""We're here!"" Why would the director even put that in there? She doesn't know where the heck she is, but she knows we're here?. It's just an all around bad movie. That's why it's getting slammed.","2.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","A parade of stupidity","Phil","I'm not sure what went wrong with movies like this. They've turned into nothing more than slasher flicks. If you can turn your brain off, then you might enjoy this movie. But if you have an analytical mind and Zeus forbid, a science background or even slight interest, then you might want to avoid this one.The entire crew does nothing but put themselves and the thousands of helpless colonists on board in danger. They are infantile, emotionally driven, and self-centered. Tennessee (Danny McBride) kept pushing the ship with thousands of colonists on board closer and closer to the atmosphere, for example, despite the warnings from the computer and from the rest of the crew. Stuff like this happens time and again.A child's basketball game has more bio-hazard protocols than these people did. We're expected to believe that they were advanced enough to fly a huge ship light years from Earth, put people in stasis for many years, etc. yet they were too stupid to have any sort of bio-hazard protocols when exploring an alien planet? Contamination / infection is what starts this whole thing off. Why make them so unbelievably stupid when there are plenty of ways to write that into the plot?The alien planet is wiped clean of ""meat"" - any sort of animal life whatsoever, yet the vegetation flourishes? That planet should have been almost completely barren, much like the mining planets of the first movies.Daniels is a weak, weepy mess. I don't think there is one single scene in the movie where she isn't weepy or in some stage of crying. I get the beginning, but after that it started to grate on me so much that I really despised her at the end. If she was supposed to be comparable to Ripley, they failed big time.It's sad that they are writing women to be so sad, immature, and weak in these movies. I miss the days when we had Ripley and Sarah Connor who were both vulnerable, frightened young women, but they ran, they fought, shot guns, kicked, and screamed. They weren't crying the entire movie and waiting for others to save them.The only reason she seemed to get as far as she did was because of outside forces intervening on her behalf. She barely fought, shot a weapon, or did anything to protect or defend herself, because she couldn't. In fact, the only two characters who seemed to have any intelligence and agency at all were David / Walter. Plus the aliens were super intelligence and basically invulnerable.There's really no backstory on the Earth situation or the alien situation. The story is so shallow it's as if they just didn't want to put ANY effort into it whatsoever. This was basically a paint by numbers hack and slack flick that happened to be in the Alien universe. That's really the only comparison that can be made with the earlier films.The end was so predictable most people will see it coming from a mile away. It was boring, uninspiring nonsense, but I guess it fit in with the rest of the film.I'm giving this film two stars because of Michael Fassbender's wonderful performance and because I really liked the cinematography and set design.","2.0 "

As per usual with most Ridley Scott films, it is beautifully filmed, the set design and costumes are superb, and with the exception of a few moments in the movie, I thought the effects were good. The positive sort of runs out there for me. I really loved Noomi Rapace in Prometheus, and by the end of the film, I really cared about her character. Even though Covenant takes place 11 years later, although Shaws absence was explained, it felt like an afterthought to me. I wanted to see more than just a picture of her. I also really struggled with David going rogue. (I don't want to spoil the movie so I'll end there) but I never saw glimmers of that in his personality in the first movie so it didn't make sense that all of a sudden he's the bad guy with this crazy agenda. Also, and I know this seems like nitpicking, but did anyone else think it was strange that David went from platinum blonde to brown hair between movies? Do synthetics rely on peroxide in space? The character personality shift just felt REALLY jarring to me. The supporting cast was good, and as usual they serve for creative ways to meet their ends at the hands of the assorted creatures. The end of the movie was a REAL letdown. It was extremely predictable AND confusing at the same time. Honestly I would say that this is a well crafted movie with a ton of plot holes that will appeal to die hard fans of the franchise as opposed to generating new ones.","2.0 "

There were some plots and scenes that were totally extraneous, and unexplained. Such as the whole beginning and the lame-o captain. Totally unnecessary. Just make Ms. Daniels the captain and cut out all the never went anywhere anyway footage. The movie really doesn't start until they find David, or he finds them. The parallels between David and Walter should have been stronger, but the issue with David's genetic manipulation of the creature answers myriad questions of the original series. The why of the 'engineers' intent on destroying a humanity they designed remains unanswered. Explain please Ridley? Without Sigourney, I'm afraid Aliens will never have anymore bite.","4.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","Man vs. the Film vs. the Machine vs. the Alien...","Andy Waitstill","Of course, there can be no other film quite like the original ""Alien"".  It is a masterpiece of paranoia, claustrophobia and sheer horror.  It is clothed in darkness and despair, aided in no small part by Signourney Weaver's excellent, empowering performance.  This, alas, is not ""Alien"" but it is smarter than ""Aliens"" and does not deserve the ridiculously low reviews written about it.  To place it, a spaceship carrying roughly 2000 human beings is hit by a solar flare and the damage, though not irreparable, does result in the death of a couple of crew members (marking the only time I've seen anyone grieve over James Franco, though this is just cattiness on my part) and makes the rest of the them long for safe harbor.  They discover a planet with an atmosphere similar to that of Earth's and they decide to disembark.  It is a beautiful yet bleak planet (heads up to cinematography for such wonderful visuals), void of animal life.  Soon, though, they find that something has been at work here.  Their trusty droid meets his predecessor and, after a time, realizes what his aim is while the rest of the crew scramble to stay alive.  The aliens in this case have taken on a humanoid yet diabolical form due to precise genetic engineering.  So what can you trust?  The acting is solemn yet proficient.  And while there's no Sigourney Weaver here, we do have the spectacle of Michael Fassbender engaged in hot man-on-man action with.. himself.  The visuals, again, are extremely impressive and the story itself is whip-smart - particularly if you really listen to Shelley's ""Ozmandias"".  And Scott has not lost any of his great directorial talent.  I suppose you could demonize the film for not having enough ""space closing in"" scenes or full-out action shoot-em-ups but why should such a director waste his time on that?  The directing follows the story and there are lots to this story here.  It seems many viewers are unable to suspend disbelief for two hours or so.  If this fits your description, don't see this film.  If you are otherwise inclined to see a story through, this comes highly recommended.","4.0 "

I am not sure the creators of Covenant watched Prometheus, as Covenant dispenses with the cliffhanger in one quick scene that does not even fit with the cliffhanger from Prometheus. It is as though the creators of Covenant wanted to dispense with the previous movie and its interesting premise as quickly as possible so that they could create yet another version of evil-A.I. takes over the world or planet or ship or whatever.

"Alien: Covenant","Fassbender is the Reason this Gets Any Stars","James Mace","***Spoilers Abound***I'm a passionate fan of both Alien and Aliens. I thought Alien 3 was awful (namely because it rendered the entire second-half plot of Aliens utterly pointless), and Resurrection was just 'meh'. I did, however, like Prometheus and the story of the Engineers / mystery about the creation of mankind. And with Ridley Scott back at the helm, I had high hopes for this one.To start with what I did actually like; Michael Fassbender as Walter / David was phenomenal. He played both characters seamlessly, and was honestly the only one who had any sort of character development. The one reason why I think this film has replay value, is watching his story unfold...plus, given the sheer idiocy of the main cast, it would seem he's doing humanity a favour! I will say that I did actually like the character of Daniels. She was no Ripley, but then, I didn't see her trying to be one either. Danny McBride was also a pleasant surprise, breaking away from the uber obnoxious characters that he's been type-cast as in the past.That said, I SO wanted to like this movie, I really did. Sadly, the art of story-telling and character development has been lost in modern cinema, with all the emphasis on CGI and special effects. CGI should be used to enhance a story, not be all there is. And when it's obvious that everything is computer generated, it kills suspension of disbelief, and feels like you're in a giant video game. This eliminates any sense of tension or suspense. The way to tell if a story is good is if you strip away all the visual effects, yet are still enthralled. That was what made the original Alien such a legendary masterpiece. The effects were minimal, yet the suspense / horror were gripping, and you were actually vested in the characters. Heck, the Xenomorph in that has (at most) two minutes of total screen time. You would think that Ridley Scott would remember the old adage, which he was at one time a master of, that ""Less is More"".What killed this movie for me was three-fold. Firstly, the terribly lazy story-telling. It did to Prometheus what Alien 3 did to Aliens. In Prometheus, Shaw was actually a likeable character, and David wasn't a complete psycho, whose character we were intrigued by. To ruin the entire story line of Prometheus, while ignominiously killing Shaw off-screen was both insulting to the audience, not to mention incredibly lazy. Mind you, I did actually like the bonus feature, where David is telling the story of why he did what he did. THAT would have been a great movie! Focus on Shaw's quest to find the Engineers and why they made us (only to later want to destroy us), then hit us with the plot twist when David goes mad and kills everyone.Instead (and my second issue), we're treated to an entirely new cast of characters, who are as utterly vapid as they are stupid. ""New world, we don't know what's down there, but let's not bother with HAZMAT suits, or helmets...what could go wrong?"" Or, ""Hey, I'm going to wander off by myself."" ""Okay, have fun."" (character dies a gruesome death) Lesson clearly not learned, as they all split up individually time and again, to the same results, which was insufferably annoying. This made the entire story SO predictable, a three-year old could know what was going to happen next. And a horror film that is predictable has failed on all levels, because it cannot scare the audience. Oh yeah, everyone also has an assault rifle with laser sights...but not one of them knows how to shoot! Seriously, these imbeciles could not hit the broadside of a barn if they were standing in it! And because there is no development of the characters at all (except maybe Daniels to a slight degree), no one watching the film cares when they are killed off. And while I kind of liked Daniels, she had some howlers as far as bad ideas go; i.e. towards the end, when she decides to go outside the landing craft to fight the Xenomorph. Um, why would you do that? All the pilot has to do is point the ship straight up and hit the afterburners (something he's getting ready to do anyway). It would have either blown off, burned up in the atmosphere, or died in the vacuum of space. That entire sequence had no suspense at all (nothing like Ripley's ""Get away from her, you *****!"") and again, felt like watching a video game.The last issue I had was with the creatures themselves. It seems that a face-hugger, which needed to be fixed to one's face for hours / days in the original, only needs less than a minute to plant an egg in Covenant. And five minutes later, out pops the chest-burster. Heck, there was a reason why the scene of Ripley finding Burke cocooned with a Xenomorph inside him was cut from Aliens (as satisfying as it would have been to see). Ridley Scott said at the time that there was no realistic way (in the laws of this universe) that Burke could be captured, have a face-hugger attached, ""impregnated"", and be able to feel it inside him, all in what was probably just a couple hours. Those rules have been flung out the window; not to mention they end up full-grown in just a couple minutes! And the whole ""less is more"", which worked so well in the original, has been done away with, which again, kills any sort of suspense, because the audience knows exactly what will happen next.Despite the plethora of issues, which I know I've repeated a lot of from other people's reviews, Alien: Covenant does still qualify as the occasional ""guilty pleasure"", if only because I really like Fassbender's David / Walter characters. As part of the Alien franchise, it falls completely flat, but as a stand-alone, I'd give it two-and-a-half stars.","2.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","As a huge fan of prometheus (despite the whole dumb characters aspect of that movie)","Chris T.","As a huge fan of prometheus (despite the whole dumb characters aspect of that movie), Alien Covenant was my most anticipated movie since 2012. I've watched prometheus 5-6 times and read numerous theories and explanations which made it more interesting to me and helped to clear up almost all of the criticisms of that movie. I feel like the same has to be done for this movie. Upon first watch there are numerous complaints and criticisms about one thing or another, but you really have to dive into further reading/analysis to get the true picture of what the writers wanted to get across. Without giving away any spoilers, I guarantee you any questions you have about this movie will be answered upon further reading online.The whole theme of Prometheus and Alien: Covenant surrounds around creation and greek mythology. The intro scene between Weyland and David is very telling and serves as an example between Humans and their creations (David), the engineers and their creations (humans) and further down, David and his ability/desire to ""create"".If you are more interested in what happened in the 10 years between prometheus and covenant, there is a book coming out sept 26, called Alien: Covenant Origins by Alan Dean Foster that plans to tell that story.","5.0 "

It's just done for the 'disgusting' factor, and once was enough way back in the original (I've never liked gore, the 80s slasher films were all a bore).  Plus, they've speeded it up and increased the ways to get an embryo inside you, so we can have little aliens pop up...or out...every so often when the story isn't moving, which is constantly.  The Two Davids was just confusing and made no sense in terms of plot, which should've been right after Prometheus, but instead was set ten years later, with nothing but a story and few seconds of video to explain what happened in between.  David just takes out the engineers like nothing, these all-snooty bald dudes, with their own ship's weapons?  So nice of them to just group together out in the open too, all happy to see one of their ships apparently, like ""Oh, there's Fraktor and Bejenna's ship.  We can start the party.  Oh, here come the party favors now!  Wait, they're really our own flesh dissolving alien-impregnating microbeads?  Damn, there goes our plot line and ""reason why"" we built humans then wanted to kill them answers that Prometheus was all about!!  Ha ha ha, screw you film fans!!""Convenient that Shaw, who's now been long dead by David's experimenting hands, happened to be such an excellent android repair person!  But it's OK, since David ""loved her.""  WTH??  See what I mean about confusing?  Why'd David do what he did?  So what happened, and how?  These lame tack-on endings meant to be surprising are just stupid, like ""Life.""  Simple editing tricks that ruin the films and their endings.Hey Ridley, time to step down and out, before you go to groin pop-out stunts, or anal ones.  Cuz this already stunk, and so did Prometheus.","2.0 "

I took to understand that with Prometheus we were asked to question human creation leading us to another planet. But an A.I. making the aliens was a path that no viewer wanted to see. What happened to Aliens being from space and humans having to fight them? In the original series Weyland Industries wanted to use the aliens for profits and weapons. I feel like with these prequels they thought that they should take everything everyone loved about Alien, Aliens, etc and not use any of what fans loved. How does someone make not 1, but 2 prequels that don't lead to the original movie?  Can't wait to see Alien Awakening in hopes this can make some kind of sense in relation to other movies.

I'm curious to see what Ridley Scott does for the next movie. The pacing is much better this time around.Katherine Waterston makes a good female lead. She isn't Ellen Ripley, but makes a good equivalent for this movie. And Danny McBride was even included for good measure; he just fits well into this equation.Best of all, Michael Fassbender's acting talent is showcased here to an even greater degree than in Prometheus. If you are a fan of his, that should be enough reason to watch this movie. I have no idea what they paid him for this, but he deserves every penny and then bonuses.","5.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","Dumbest crew ever destroys human kind","DA","This movie is a prequel to the original Alien film. Unlike its original film, this movie stinks. It has extremely good visuals but that is it.The movie is about an incompetent group of colonists. They embarked on a 10 years journey to a planet that they have preselected through years of research and sending probes. Along the way, they discover a faint radio tune that sounds like ""Take me Home"" by John Denver. With this vague, very faint, and very unknown radio signal, they decided it was a great idea to jeopardize the entire 2000+ colonists to investigate this just discovered planet. Once they land on the planet, they decide it's a great idea to send out the most important crew, and breathe in the air. Aside from common sense disease control, why would you risk breathing in air from an unknown planet? Not only that, as soon as someone gets sick, they just decide it's a great idea to bring them all back to the ship. No quarantine, nothing. Especially after something explodes out of someone.To put it mildly, the plot of this movie is dumb, and unbelievable. It feels like they dumbed down the plot to make it into a ""sophisticated"" movie that questions life, science, and religion. Instead it turns out to an unbelievable plot that's not even close to what the original Alien franchise brought. When Alien first came out, we seen a crew fight against an unknown monster. Then Aliens came out and we seen just how vulnerable people are even when equipped with the best. Aliens 3 was okay and far better than any of the current movies.Overall I would avoid this movie. The next Alien film that comes out, I'll be sure to skip it. The Alien became so complex and silly that it becomes a catch 22 paradox. Some alien hated humans so they created a biological weapon to wipe them out, but on the flip side humans created the perfect monster after they created the perfect android human. It goes in an infinite chain loop and who knows what crazy paradox the next movie comes out. At this point, it's very clear they're just using the alien franchise as a way to make money.","1.0 "

Seriously folks, I haven't been this disappointed in a movie since I watched the trailer for the new Ghostbusters film. This movie broke new ground in how utterly horrible current hollywood is at writing / casting / producing a quality movie.Where to start?? The acting was terrible...not terrible for a blockbuster movie franchise, terrible for any movie. All the scenes felt forced, the lines felt forced, and the emotion was also blatantly forced. Speaking of emotion, why is it that all white male characters in the new hollywood are all incompetent / emotionally driven morons that need a strong female character to swoop in and save the day?My friends, even the most fanciful sci-fi movies do not pass the threshold of completely unbelievable. This film passed it about 15 minutes in when there was trouble on the ship...EVERY LIGHT AND COMPUTER SCREEN FLASHES. What kind of futuristic starship that travels to the edge of the galaxy has this problem? Seriously, every time there's trouble with one of the shipsthe lights and computer screens flash, after the emergency passes they all suddenly go back to normal.And hey, let's not forget about the fluorescent light bulbs in the futuristic starships too! They also tend to flash on and off in rough weather, but after exiting rough weather they go back to normal. How the heck do these ships make it across the galaxy with such terrible power? Also, sometimes these craft are easily combustible but other times they can fly through and break apart solid stone statues...To make a long story short:If you like:Unbelievable plotsbad actingregurgitated plot traps / twistsrip offs from previous episodesridiculous technologyMan hatingSJW crusadesThen by all means rent this, you'll probably end up buying it.For the rest of us that treasure the original first few Alien movies, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!

Yes, there is some questionable 'science' in this film. That stuff can and has been picked apart here, just as it was for Prometheus.But - and this is important from a reviewing standpoint - Covenant also has a superbly atmospheric gothic-romantic-space-horror thing going on. Of course we go into these Alien-derived films expecting gory thrills but at this point there's something a lot more interesting to watch happening onscreen than just wondering when the next alien will attack. Forget the science, don't worry too much about xenomorphs, and enjoy the weird, surprisingly poetic throwback tale being told here.There are enough minor frustrations and 'I think it could've been better in this way...' spots for me that I'm tempted to give Covenant 3 stars, but what it does well it does well enough that I'll give it 4 stars. I'm only a purist in that I think that the original Alien is still the best film in this franchise. I'd say that with all due respect to Aliens, if you're looking for the atmosphere of the original then Covenant while a very different film in some ways, is in other ways closer to the original, especially in terms of aesthetic.

Lots of close calls and dumb moves by the humans who all end up dying.

Turns out that was just a filthy lie or wishful thinking. Things took a turn when I saw Micheal Fassbender reprising his role as David, because the movie loves to 'explore' philosophical concepts with him in the same way a runaway bulldozer ""explores"" an art museum, only with more damage and less subtlety. I hung in there though. In the end, it wasn't even my loathing for Prometheus that made me stop watching - it was the bland, stupid characters and their blaring disregard for common sense or training. The last straw was when a character orders a ship full of hibernating colonists suicidally close to a storm system, not to rescue people (he can't because this colony ship only has one shuttle for all umpteen thousand people and their supplies) but to maybe, MAYBE get better reception on a report about his wife. I just couldn't relate to that kind of blind stupidity, and I stopped.

"Alien: Covenant","A Mean-Spirited Sequel to an Underwhelming Movie (Some Spoilers)","R","Alien: Covenant had the potential to be one of the best in the series. Although its visual design and pacing are a far cry from Alien and Aliens, it does an excellent job in both those respects. Alien: Covenant starts with a tense, sad, but hopeful opening. Our crew this time consists of a few terraforming experts, pilots, and a small security detatchment, led by a captain who has been pused into a deep end that he cannot swim. These individuals are responsible for getting 2,000 colonists and 1,500 embryos to a new world. After a neutrino burst breaks their ship's solar sails, the crew recieves a distress signal from an uninhabitated, but pristine, planet. The crew sets down on the planet to find the source of the familiar distress signal, as well as survey this new world as a potential alternative to their original destination. But we, the audience, are aware of the dramatic irony; this is not a safe place and our crew is in for a fight for survival. Standout cast members include Katherine Waterston as Daniels (our strong but troubled female lead), Billy Crudup as Captain Oram (the reluctantly promoted captain with a lack of charisma and confidence), and Danny McBride (who plays Tennessee). Danny McBride is especially surprising here. His character is played straight for the most part and it was delightful to watch him flex his drama muscles. Waterston, Crudup, and McBride perfectly portray people placed into a horrifying situtation, who struggle to keep their cool. Waterston and McBride are both terrified, barely hiding their terror under the surface, but they are able to push past it and overcome their desperate situation. The casting was brilliant; the actors seemed genuinely terrified, which sent chills up my spine.There are some issues with pacing, it is a long movie but it still felt like it was moving too fast; there was very little tension building before horrifying events. That being said, I was surprised by how terrifying this movie was. Despite the fast pace, Ridley Scott was still able to create this feeling of unease. The neomorphs, a disturbing breed of xenomorph we have not seen before, are shown very little. And when they are shown they are incredibly horrifying. There is something not quite right about the way they move. The neomorphs move with the grace of the xenomorph in Alien, with the agility of the xenomorphs in Aliens, and with a disturbing herky-jerkiness and stiffness often seen in old rod-puppets. The image of an 8 foot tall rod puppet closing in on its prey is one I will not soon forget. A moment involving a character's eyes rolling back into their head is similarly burned into my brain. It should have been and could have been the film Alien fans were waiting for. It combines horror (a horror even greater than Alien), with excellent characters, cramped corridors, and dark, foreboding lighting.Despite how perfect this all seems, Alien Covenant is completely ruined by how mean-spirited it is. The film has no respect for its characters; their sole reason for existing is so that awful things happen to them, rather than advancing the story. This disrespect for its own characters seems like it was taken straight out of The Walking Dead or a critically panned, modern horror movie. The script's treatment of Elizabeth Shaw (our protagonist from Prometheus) is particularly disturbing. Her character has been desecrated by this movie; she appears as a literally desecrated corpse. The movie further insults its own characters during its last 15 minutes, where the film becomes a fun, terrifying, condensed version of Alien. But our endearing characters are given an ending that felt like a middle finger to both them and the audience. It is a metaphorical gut punch that simply sets up a sequel that can torture its main characters too.Alien: Covenant is more than a return to form for the Alien franchise; in many ways it felt like an advancement. It made action-horror feel fresh and legitimately terrifying. Alien: Covenant is a departure from Prometheus. But, unfortunately, it seems to be a departure driven by spite toward audiences and critics, who criticized the artistic decisions made in the lackluster Prometheus.","1.0 "

Most will expect to walk into this viewing another Alien film. This is not another Alien film. It is something psychologically much darker, and much more disturbing. Do yourself a favor and go watch Prometheus, and then follow-up with viewing this film.

David is thrust upon us once more, the homicidal android who sees himself as superior to organic beings. Hmmm, this is not an original idea at all, and the stupidity of the crew justifies David's position. There are so many excellent, on point, bad reviews that I am not going to dissect Covenant.

"Alien: Covenant","The Best Since Aliens","Movie Nerd","“ ***1/2: (Spoiler Heavy) I would have gave it **** if I didn't see the twist coming a mile away. Otherwise Alien: Covenant is the best since Alien and Aliens.I just felt like Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) got the Hicks and Newt Alien 3 treatment. David (Michael Fassbender) proves here that he's the key character of these movies. We don't root for people to survive though just for them to die off screen. Who says Scott won't do that again with the 3rd film.I enjoyed most the movie but a lot of people die because they were stupid. When some creepy Android says ""follow me, I want to show you something."" You don't go especially if that creepy Android is David.So I felt like there were some horror cliches. Especially with ""the everything is fine...oh wait no it's not!"" typical horror movie ending.I am not exactly defending why Alien: Covenant is one of the best though. The film is engaging and interesting during it's slow moments. I enjoyed learning more of why David does what he does.I like that he actually says ""curiosity killed the cat!"" Since that's what I was thinking about him. His curiosity is very dangerous. The film does skip the whole ""who created us ?"" plot of Prometheus. However, David is the creator these films is interested in. It's about creation. Not ours though. The xenomorphs....I find that intriguing and is why my Thumb is up.","4.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","Dumb...and even DUMBER!","Le Stryge","Okay, you've all seen ""Prometheus"" yes?This takes place AFTER that, so you might expect these people to have at least learned something from what has gone before?Not a chance!Once again we have more ""scientists"" ..(and I'm using that word very loosely here you understand), wandering off their gazillion dollar mission to land on an unknown planet.Here they blithely wander about with total disregard for the fact that there might be deadly pathogens. THERE ARE!And ones to which humans would have no immunity. THEY DON'T!Once again, just like in ""Prometheus"" no one takes any regard of even the most basic quarantine procedures....AT ALL!And so once again we have a movie of dumb people doing even dumber things.And the pitiful sight of a supposedly highly trained female scientist going into a blind screaming panic, shooting wildly about and managing to destroy the landing vehicle itself rather than the alien!If you have even the most basic intelligence you will find yourself always about two pages AHEAD of the script here.You'll pre-suppose every aspect of the plot, from how the alien gets in, who it is incubating within, when it's the BAD android and not the good one, even down to blowing the invader out an airlock just like we've seen before, as it struggles to remain inside!That process also manages to lose most of the heavy equipment one supposes might have been vital to the success of the original mission.They had the thing isolated within a sealed off section of the ship whilst they were wearing space suits!So why not just open an outer door, thereby venting the atmosphere making the chamber a vacuum and kill the alien that way?I was monumentally disappointed in this.The very first ""Alien"" scared the hell out of me, and even now, although I have seen it many times, it still manages to create such a tense atmosphere. ""Covenant"" has no characters that you really care about, there's no chemistry between any of them, (despite an idiotic shower sex scene between two of them that uses up far more water than would be allowed in space!)Even the CGI ""aliens"" are no match for those shown way back in the original.The frustrating ending leaves a possibility of yet another movie, (naturally...let's wring another out of the corpse!) but one very quickly surmises that if those colonists and fetuses in suspended animation are anywhere near as incompetent, not to mention as downright stupid as those we have already met, then they too are little more than frozen dinners in storage for the aliens.ONE star FROM me....and NO stars FOR me for being sucked in to watching this thing with hopes that it would be in any way better than ""Prometheus"".AVOID!","1.0 "

In this case the author was able to get access to the screen writers and ridley Scott himself and get more background information as far as things that had been cut and also as far as what people were thinking in their head in their inner monologue that was in the script that people had obviously act out.

No cop outs, just new light on a pretty stellar franchise. A rarity in any IP these days. Like Prometheus, it absolutely demands a second viewing.

"Alien: Covenant","Looking for more of the same? Congratulations! You have found it...exactly! (Warning: Spolier Alert)","R. Smith","I was hoping that there would be something new...I mean REALLY new....the way ALIENS was ""new"" to the 1979 original ALIEN. The original itself was new in many ways. Offered so much fresh sci-fi horror. Aliens added all the space marine technology and really stood out as an excellent sequel.This one...not so much. It is same old same old at almost every level. Sure, there is a revelation here or there, such as what REALLY happened to Elizabeth Shaw and David. A new take on the Alien critter bursting out someone's back rather than chest? Whoo Hoo!  None of these ""new"" elements made this worth the $17.99 purchase price.Remember in ALIEN, at the end, Sigourney is running through the ship, warning tones are blasting, yellow caution lights flashing, and your heartbeat raced with hers as she tried to defeat the critter? Yeah? Well, none of THAT kind of suspense occurs here. It is calm. In fact, this movie is too calm given it is the 2017 release of the ALIEN franchise.Has Hollywood used this as another attack vehicle? Sure thing! The male captain is a ""man of faith"" who cannot lead and is a squirming heap of emotions compared to his female second who is a take charge leader. In fact, she is the one that destroys the critter in the end. Taking the kids to see it? Swell.But you might want to be prepared to explain the robot homosexual moment, a gentle kiss on the lips between David and Walter. And be prepared further to explain the interracial shower scene in which the Alien critter apparently gets ""exploratory"" with the female before mouth-punching the male. My how those Alien critters love to use that little mouth-fist thingie which is inside their own mouth to mouth-punch their human victims.It is fairly bloody. Lots of puking and gore-chucking. No really terrifying moments such as when the little girl was down beneath the floor in Aliens and the critters were closing in on her. Nothing even remotely that intense here. Had I not seen the previous releases in the franchise, this might have been better. However, for my money, it is just blatantly more of the same.","3.0 "

The design, atmosphere, acting, & pacing are near flawless. Are there 5 or 6 examples of characters making incredibly idiotic choices? Yep! Are some of the twists predictable? Yep! But it kept me riveted for the 2 hours plus of run time, and that cannot be said of 90% of genre movies these days. It's better than Prometheus and better by far than the last two Ripley entries. If you're expecting a film equal to the first two, well, give me some of what you're smoking. This is a hybrid of those two films and Prometheus, and the result is a more-than-worthy addition to the franchise. I hope the loud whiners don't rob us of another Alien movie by Scott in the years to come.","5.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","A True Prequel to the Original Alien Film... Finally.","Jon Arbuckle","I honestly don't know why this movie is getting such blatant hatred... I read some of the 1 and 2 star reviews, but the only reasoning people could come up with is ""boring"", ""terrible storyline"", ""Prometheus cast was scratched"", etc... well first of all, the only two Prometheus cast members left were Shaw and David, and 50% of that remaining cast is in this film... twice. So given the vague, two dimensional, and poorly put together reasoning, I'd have to say the negative reviews were written worse than the supposed horribly written movie script. The only cause for such apathy that I can think of is that people these days hate originality... They seem to want cut and paste, cookie cutter blueprint scripts that retread the same old ground because it's safe. Hence, the boring movies that come out these days (many of them remakes all done the same way) that all end up blockbuster smash hits. The bottom line is that the movie going audience has been dumbed down to an exceptional level that only wants movies that appeal to the lowest common denominator... much like the music they listen to (you know, the garbage that ends up Billboard #1s, winning Grammys every year.But enough about society's ignorance, back to the movie for any intelligent people still reading... I do understand people WON'T like this movie and that's your prerogative but come up with better reasoning than ""it's stupid and boring""... if you can force yourself thru the horrors of watching a movie made before the year 2000 (ugh, so old!), you'll realize that STORY was a bit of a component to movie making ""way back then""...This movie has a lot more action and tension than Prometheus, so I honestly am a bit confused as to why the mainstream audience didn't enjoy it more. I liked Prometheus but it's main drawback in my eyes was how far it was from the Alien franchise, save for a few plot devices from the originals that Scott expanded into main plot points of the first prequel... advertising it as a prequel to ALIEN, I would have hoped there was more relating to ALIEN, no? Covenant starts out much the same for about half the movie, although it plays more like the original film did in building the story. But the moment I started seeing those pre-Alien things, I was afraid I was in for another movie based on one or two ideas from the original franchise and I started getting irritated.. but fear not, at the sake of a BIT OF A SPOILER, these Prometheus era creatures, disappear fairly quickly and we finally get to see the Alien that we've come to know and love... which is the way it SHOULD be since it was titled as an official ALIEN film.There are a few moments of thick tension, obviously not as many as the original tho because movies just aren't written that way anymore (mainstream attention spans cannot fathom watching a 90 minute movie based on STORY anymore like Chinatown or Bonnie and Clyde, without a bunch of sex, gore, and killing). This is a strong movie in its own right, with a lot of meaning between the lines, like the concept of the desire to play God in human nature and WHY these things were created moreso than the HOW. A movie that tackles these types of ideas will generally have a lot more depth to it than your average Seth Rogan/James Franco 90 minute penis joke marketed as a film. So for the 2 people that think outside society's box of groupthink that bothered to read this far, I highly recommend checking this one out WITH AN OPEN MIND if you're a fan of the original Alien film, and films of substance and meaning as well... I guarantee you'll take a lot more away from it than all those people that turned it off halfway thru because they didn't see a group of marines spouting the F-word every 20 seconds and blowing away hordes of xenomorphs every 5 minutes.","4.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","It's a movie. It won't kill your dog or anything. But it sure isn't a good movie.","Computer Guy","Alien: Covenant shows Scott listening to all of the criticism of Prometheus; listening to it, then taking all of the things people hated most and ramping them up several degrees. People with ascribed characteristics--like ""scientist""--do incredibly stupid things.People we don't know or care about, pretty much everyone, get killed in completely avoidable ways, with characters having to go out of their way to be so incompetent with firearms they cause more harm than an army of aliens could. From the moment they wake up, every single crew member does everything possible to break every single unwritten rule of survival.Walk into an unknown atmosphere on an unknown planet with no scanning for microbial life, spores, pollen, potential unbreathable gas layers or pockets? Sure.Walk over unsurveyed grounds? Stand in untested liquids? Walk on and through unknown wildlife? Assume illnesses and odd behavior happened for no reason or were carryovers from the ship? Build safety glass windows out of spun sugar? Touch everything in a ship of unknown origin figuring the controls gotta do something good or meaningful? At some point it seems like the ship Covenant was filled with the opposite of Earth's best and brightest, sent off to be killed.Already pretentious, a ship named ""Covenant"" searching for a garden of Eden in what amounts to a space ark filled with mating pairs, one character has to announce he's a man of faith and then do absolutely nothing that indicates he is a man of faith.""RELIGION"" has to play some role here, somewhere, but other than names and window dressing it is only the conversations between David and Walter that speaks to religion, and in such trite ways one wonders if the synthetics were damaged in transit.  The ""man of faith""'s gross incompetence and stupidity are pretty much the catalyst for the entirety of the ""bad things happen"" section, also known as Alien: Covenant. Also, even if this were the distant future, the chances that at least half the people on the ship were ""people of faith"" seems fairly high. The major monotheistic religions are not just going to disappear in 100 years and yet he seems to think he is the only person who believes in God/Allah/Yahweh.Also of note: the future looks very white. This seems to be the opposite of where demographics are pointing but maybe something happens. I don't know. It didn't draw me out of the movie, as the plot, dialogue, characterizations (as such), misunderstanding of basic scientific principles and strange FX choices did that on their own, but still ... strange.I'll write ""SPOILERS"" but Alien is a pretty old movie, so not spoiling much:In Alien, Ripley did everything right. That is she stuck to quarantine protocols; she spoke to Dallas about actually acting like a captain, keeping Ash in check and protecting the crew members; and she kept double checking what she was being told. She was always thinking and processing information. The fact Ash betrayed her and the crew, overrode the quarantine protocols and did everything to keep the alien alive was not her fault, nor did she know Ash was a synthetic/android/replicant. Granted, I don't think Jonesy was important enough to risk one's life for, but she needed something to focus on.In Aliens, Ripley again does most everything right. She doesn't want to go. She warns everyone they are underestimating the threat. And once it becomes a matter of survival she does everything she can to survive and protect her surrogate daughter. She also does not run in a straight line to avoid a large ship falling in a perfectly straight path on top of her. I'm not saying she had the chance, but damn, Ripley is the opposite of the morons who show up in later films.Endish ""SPOILERS""Alien3 is not so much a matter of her screwing up or acting out of character as it is some strange writing and directing choices. Even the oh so much religious symbolism, works better than the painted on symbolism in Prometheus and Alien: Covenant. It is in this film that the Alien series opened up to a larger religious mythology and one that set the ground for ignoring, seemingly, everything else in Prometheus and A:C. The less said about 4 the better, though it was at least entertaining.The problems with P and A:C is that they both got wrong every single thing that worked in the originals. The chest bursting in Alien was shocking, but it wasn't the point of the movie. In P and A:C we get a lot of bursting, and drool, and blood and fluids and just a lot of everything that make up artists and effects people probably enjoy. In Alien the Engineer was mysterious but needed no explanation, yet P and A:C are dedicated to telling us so much about the Engineers. Weyland Yutani is evil (not even evil really, just profit driven at the cost of all ethical considerations. Or maybe that is evil): we don't need to know a thing about Weyland's quest for immortality or finding the/a creator. In A and A2 no one is searching for their creators, they are trying to live when faced with a terrifying, adaptable, nearly undefeatable organism.What is Weyland-Yutani's weapon plans, by the way? Is this some commentary on nuclear or biological weapons in the current day? It can't be controlled, it will escape and exterminating it once it gets to your planet is nigh on impossible. Who exactly are they attacking? Do they know the Yautja (Predators) exist? If someone wants to expand the Alien universe, why not tell us what other species there are rather than announcing the only other one I remembered name, Arcturians, are great for sex? The space marines say they have been in fights before: with what? Another ""Bug Hunt"" indicates there was possibly a first bug hunt. Or several bug hunts. What were they hunting? I doubt these were all coders turned space marines, even given their seemingly poor understanding of tactics, strategy and survival.I see people complain about sequels and remakes. And for the most part (minus Lucas and Spielberg) remakes, sequels and ""fine-tuning"" of the original doesn't destroy the originals and my enjoyment of them. Speaking of which: Han did not shoot first: Han shot. There was only one shot. Greedo died. But Scott is trying awfully hard to create a Rashomon-style wreath of misinformation and doubt around the first two movies, so we might question what they were really about. He can't make Alien less great but he can make sure younger people only familiar with the most recent two movies never develop a desire to see the good movies.Anyway, this is a big, beautiful, noisy movie which takes as much thought to watch as it did to film, which is none. Any thought the watcher puts into it is way more than the writers or director did and will probably result in immediate ideas for infinitely better films that could have been made for 1/10 the budget. I suppose, if you are a masochistic completest and hold out some hope all the reviews are wrong, watch the film. I did. After prometheus I thought it would be impossible to be disappointed. I was incorrect.","2.0 "

The script is pure nonsense! The story was, well, there wasn't one that made any sense. Yet again, a huge spaceship on a long voyage has the just awakened crew go investigate a mysterious message! Really! It spirals down from there.  Rent ""Bambi vs Godzilla"" instead. It's only 2 minutes long and it has a story.","1.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","Alien: Covenant (2017) Review","Anthony L. Wallace","It was 38 years ago that movie watchers were introduced to ‘Alien‘ back in 1979. Director Ridley Scott would go on to terrify audiences with a gut wrenching, hair raising cat and mouse game when space truckers encounter a deadly beast in deep space. A first of its kind that would spawn rip-offs that pales in comparison to a horror masterpiece. Then 33 years later, Scott would return to the universe that solidified his career with 2012’s ‘Prometheus‘. His return was met with praise and frustration as the movie had high production value but lacked in answering it’s big questions.This now leads us to the follow-up in ‘Alien: Covenant‘ where Ridley Scott promises to bring back the Xenomorphs and the carnage fans came to love. And he also provides answers to the many lingering pains that were left unanswered in ‘Prometheus‘. After months and months of anticipation the time has finally arrived where fans look forward to a much needed Alien sequel. What one has to wonder is if fans will be satisfied for what has been a tumultuous journey up to this point.As a colony ship, the Covenant, advances towards its destination of a new home they are hit by a neutrino burst. The crew awakens from cryo-sleep to then intercept a signal from a nearby planet that closely resembles earth. While investigating this new world they discover what turns out to be a deadly game of survival when death and chaos awaits their arrival. The film stars Katherine Waterston, Michael Fassbender, Billy Crudup, and Danny McBride.I was in the minority of those who enjoyed ‘Prometheus‘ and praised the direction and production that was put into the project. The idea of the Engineers was clever as it brought about the idea of creators of mankind who then turn on their creation. Michael Fassbender’s David makes a strong presence as the newly created android by the Weyland Corporation as his ability to be curious takes on a life of its own. Going into ‘Alien: Covenant‘ I was looking forward to another strong performance by Michael Fassbender as this time around he plays not only David but the Covenant’s new android Walter.The way to describe ‘Alien: Covenant‘ is a little frustrating because as much as it tries to be an Alien movie it also tries being a sequel to ‘Prometheus‘. And a lot of it has to do with Ridley Scott trying to appease the fan bases in both camps. Starting with the positives the movie is beautiful to look at. If there’s one thing everyone can agree on is that Ridley Scott knows how to produce and direct. From the external shots of the Covenant ship to the landscapes of the Engineer’s home world they are breathtaking to watch. Even the cast do a decent job while falling one by one to deadly pathogens.Lead actress Katherine Waterston plays the distressed co-captain alongside Billy Crudup’s Oram. The director’s belief in casting strong females for the role has proven to be true as was the case of Sigourney Weaver. Except she isn’t meant to surpass Weaver’s performance in the franchise rather to demonstrate the tenacity as she fights for her life. Unfortunately, a large chunk of the runtime is dedicated to Michael Fassbender’s David/Walter as he continues to explore the idea of creation. But that’s what saves the film from floundering into familiar gasps and terror. David takes things to the next level and that’s when he truly becomes a terrifying menace.Now we come to the difficult part because as much as the we’re entertained by Michael Fassbender and the visual prowess of Ridley Scott, the film struggles to balance in tone. When we explore the terrain of an uncharted paradise it’s hard not to forget ‘Prometheus‘ and the scientific expedition that took place as they journey to find humanity’s origins. Then there comes a point when the monsters arrive, a.k.a the back-burster, and the many other creatures that show up in the film. The creatures almost seemed to take the backseat or were merely around to make an appearance. A good chunk of the film glides around the questions of the Engineers and how David survives a hostile environment. There never were smooth transitions between the terror and the grand ideas set by the script. It’s unfortunate because the lack of substance behind the Engineers is something I was hoping to see more of.There’s going to be disappointment and that’s because the script tries to please everyone but not in a satisfying way that we’d hope. Great performances by the cast; more specifically Michael Fassbender and even the one and only Danny McBride. There are terrifying moments in the movie and I wouldn’t even say its the aliens themselves. If you were put off by the religious and scientific garble in ‘Prometheus‘ then don’t expect it to go away. In fact, it may be more blatant as the movie does explore the ideas of heaven and hell. If you’re a fan of the aliens then you will also be disappointed because their mysterious beginnings may spoil the lore that fans have enjoyed for many years.It may take subsequent viewings to change my perspective on ‘Alien: Covenant‘ as time goes on. But in the way I was thoroughly in awe of ‘Prometheus‘ on its first viewing it may be a tough mountain to climb. This is not an easy review because although I tried not to go in with expectations I still ended up feeling somewhat let down. The last thing I will mention is the sound score by Jed Kurzel. He did a great job by mixing in the sound of Jerry Goldsmith’s ‘Alien‘ with this movie. There was a great use of buildup when things started going awry. It made me feel like we returned to Ridley Scott’s world and bringing back memories of how great the original ‘Alien‘ was. Though the latest entry in the franchise isn’t a deal breaker it certainly reminds us how special a filmmaker is able to explore the unknowns while terrifying its audience in the process.","3.0 "

And then you get to see trained professionals acting like scared grade-school kids when things go wrong.

"Alien: Covenant","EPIC RANT: Alien Covenant (SPOILERS)","Damian Cossetto","(SPOILER WARNING) Alien: Covenant is a 2017 sci-fi/horror film directed by Ridley Scott and written by John Logan and Dante Harper, with a story by Michael Green and Jack Paglen. It stars Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, and Danny Mcbride. The film takes place 10 years after Prometheus, revolving around a large crew. After one of the crew members (played by James Franco, who gets about as much screentime as Bryan Cranston does in Godzilla (2014)) dies when a stellar neutrino burst damages the ship. The crew goes to a nearby planet. And they land on the planet. One of them dies when a Neomorph bursts out of his back, while another Neomorph bursts out of some other guy's mouth somehow. In my honest opinion, this movie, was a godawful train wreck.  The characters were even dumber than in Prometheus (and believe me, Prometheus had some really dumb characters, mostly in their decision making). They land on this alien planet with no helmets whatsoever, they touch everything thats there (from wheat to pods that will obviously lead to their gruesome demise). Then, 2 girls bring a dying crewmember back to their ship. He's coughing blood, and his back's starting to tear open. One girl locks the other in the medical room with the dying crewmember (yeah, I forgot their names), and then a Neomorph (a new alien species) rips through his back. Whenever you see these neomorphs, I think Yakety-Sax might as well be playing in the soundtrack because everything that happens around this creature is so ridiculously cartoonish and stupid. Then the girl from before comes back with a gun, and slips on a pile of blood, getting the neomorph's attention, like out of a slapstick comedy. And then she fires her gun at the alien. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your POV), she accidentally blows up the ship while the neomorph escapes.  The acting ranges from mediocre to just plain awful. Michael Fassbender was okay (I'm sorry, but I find Michael Fassbender overrated), but he's given a horrendous script and I'm betting he must've felt embarassed delivering awful lines such as ""you blow and I'll do the fingering"" (during a scene when David (the not-so-good android) teaches Walter (the good android) how to play a flute). Also, Danny Mcbride was good as well, but he's given nothing to do and he's only in the movie for like, 20 minutes so neither of them save this movie. Remember when I said that the characters are even dumber? Here's another example. David leads the crew's captain into a room (in retaliation for killing the Neomorph) full of strange eggs, and David tells the captain to look inside the egg, and he foolishly does so, resulting in a facehugger infecting him. After what feels like 5 minutes, a Xenomorph bursts out of his chest. Instead of a chestburster, we get a full sized alien, but small. The newborn xeno raises his arms like he's gonna sing (he doesn't). (I'm just gonna spoil the ending) The movie ends pretty much the same way the first movie ended (they get the alien into a certain part of the ship, blow it out into space where it floats away), except 10 times worse. The attempts at suspense fail miserably, the music blows chunks. It's not visually impressive (the alien planet looks like something out of the rocky mountains).  The CGI looks laughably bad (like on par with movies like Sharktopus or The Eden Formula). There were several scenes where I swear it looked like the aliens weren't rendered completely. There's a scene towards the end where the xenomorph climbs down a ladder, it's dorsal tubes clip right through the floor. And this movie had a budget of around 97 million dollars, and only came out a couple of months ago, unacceptable. And also the writing and lack of any direction was so embarassingly bad it lead me to believe Uwe Boll might've secretly had a hand at making this garbage. Also the tone the movie gave off just didn't work and it came across as extremely pretentious. And the overall look of the movie is just generic. In case I haven't made it clear enough, don't watch Alien: Covenant. You're better off watching Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986). Alien: Covenant gets 0.5/10. If you want 2 androids playing a flute and kissing, characters that are dumber than a sack of diapers, and a climax that will piss you off more than your spouse cheating on you? If so, THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU!!!! If not, avoid this flaming pile of space trash like the plague. So that's pretty much my thoughts on Alien: Covenant. If you like this movie, that's fine. I did not. And for those that care, I have no intention of seeing the next one, Alien: Awakening. And this rant was coming from someone who's not only a huge fan of the alien franchise, but was actually looking forward to this.","1.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","Truly hateful and terrible","Jack Ryan","Wow. A colossal failure, as massively depressing and enraging as Prometheus, which is really saying something. Once again, a preposterously idiotic crew is handed responsibility for a zillion-dollar spacecraft and a humanity-saving mission, and proceeds to make one ludicrously stupid decision after another, bringing predictable doom to themselves and the rest of the human race. As they were killed off one by one I felt like cheering. They deserved it. They had no business going into space. You wouldn't trust most of them with going down the block to get you a coffee. Once again, the androids are the only characters who are kind of interesting, or even distinguishable. Scott's movies have suggested in the past a preference for artificials over humans, but never so obviously or insultingly. Once again, the director who started it all off 40 years ago barely goes through the motions, trashing his own legacy and legend. Every time this movie egregiously cited a line, a scene or a visual cue from Alien or Aliens -- which it does a LOT -- I wished I was watching Alien or Aliens instead. This would be a bad movie even if it weren't destroying that legacy, but the fact that it does such cynical and careless violence to one of the foundations of modern pop mythology makes it truly hateful and terrible, and strongly  suggests that Scott thoroughly despises that legacy and all of us idiots who ever liked it..","1.0 "

For example, later in the film, when almost all of the crew have been slaughtered by the xenomorphs and they narrowly escaped a previously-unknown with the remnants of a civilization, two crew members decide to get it on in the shower. Nothing like having all of your co-workers slaughtered in deep space to get you in the mood for a little steamy shower scene.

They go down to investigate, and mayhem ensues. The worst part is, these people, who are a supposed highly trained scientists, do everything wrong. They arbitrarily land a vehicle, and leave the ship to search for a mysterious transmission they heard from the planet. Why walk, when you have a vehicle that can take you closer? One guy actually EATS some plant that looks like wheat on earth. Another splits himself off from the group to ""take a leak"" (no problem contaminating a biosphere you know nothing about, eh?)

In the movie prior to this, from which this is supposed to the be the second (or another in the ""Alien"" franchise), the sick bay had an advanced, 3d imaging and advanced working bed, that showed all the workings of the body, and, even, if I remember brought someone back to life. In this  movie, when one of the crew becomes ""ill"", they are put on a regular bed, and they were trying to insert an iv in his convulsing body. Too bad, the movie is so dumb.

"Alien: Covenant","Better than Prometheus...barely","King Reviewer","Alien Covenant is a stylish looking film, pretty solid hard sci-fi beginnings that fairly quickly becomes a action/adventure romp that is pretty satisfying, despite the same unexplainable human reasoning of not wearing high-tech space suits and weaponry that can both easily protect the human crew from alien organisms that infect the spacefarers.If you can overlook these glaring ongoing issues, which I am quite surprised a long-time top director who seems to surround himself with quality filmmakers, i.e., writers who obviously need some help on explaining these issues we critics keep pointing out with each successive movie, (humans making stupid, obvious choices, weapons that seem kinda high-tech one movie, then are low tech in the next. Previous movie has high-tech space suits, then next one doesn't...at least when it counts the most - planetside.)As great as computer CGI has gotten, I still wish they would utilize real creature FX, i.e., human disguised as the alien, or mechanical means.The best parts of the movie is the synthetic David messing with the humans and his 'brother.' This creates solid suspense and mystery all the way to the cliffhanger ending.And if you don't like HUGE cliffhanger movie endings, then this one will truly piss you off.","4.0 "

However, on the way to the said planet, the crew discovers an uncharted plane, but could this planet prove to be their salvation or certain death from unimaginable horrors...This movie picks up ten years after the events of ""Prometheus"" (2012), and before the events of ""Alien"" (1979), which were also directed by Scott. Because of this, ""Covenant"" shares similar tones and brings back the eerie claustrophobic horror that is the hallmark of the Alien franchise. Scott builds an imaginitive universe, drawing upon influences from his previous works including ""Gladiator"" (2000) and ""The Martian"" (2015), and shoots one of his most beautiful movies to date. The planets, spaceships (check out the ship that uses sails to draw solar power), and dark corridors all look hauntingly beautiful and feel lived in as well as dangerous.Besides the great cinematography, the actors involved also bring in their A games. Fassbender portrays the hauntingly, eccentric cyborg; Waterston the lost and confused officer; and McBride the wild pilot and prove to be the standouts of the movie, but everyone does a great job in the acting department. Unfortunately, the movie also falls into the similar horror tropes of past Alien movies and slasher flicks as characters decide to go off by themselves - and you can easily predict who is going to die and who is not if you watched these type of movies. Although the xenomorph and Scott's sensibilities make this movie stand apart from other slasher flicks, I can't help but think that this movie felt more like a slasher flick with a xenomorph rather than a full fledged Alien movie - especially with the multiple plotlines that unfolded all at once. Still if I were to rate this amongst other Alien flicks, I would say that this movie is better than Alien 3, Prometheus, and Resurrection, but fails to reach the heights of Alien and Aliens.","4.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","Some spoilers ...GOOD movie","Sahar","Better than Prometheus, which I completely disliked. Its right there with the third movie in the franchise. Nothing and I mean nothing, Scott puts out will beat the first and second movies in the franchise. They are classics and revolutionary in regards to women roles, space military, dialogue and set design. No need to compare because neither thing will touch them.  So, Alien Covenant is a good movie that moves right along. Nothing slow about it. Its the second in a series of films leading to the 1979 movie. I'm absolutely okay with how the alien is being developed by David and the face huggers. Its taking him time and over the next two films there should be a perfecting of the alien that will vet us to understand what Ripley said....""they cut the power"". Hudson, ""what do you mean they cut the power, they're just animals."" LOL.... apparently they are being designed to be more. Much more.","4.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","Don't put your face there.","Renter","Movies like this are why I sometimes wish Amazon would allow half stars. It is not as good as the first two entrees in the franchise, but it's by far not the worst one. I would say it's about equal to Prometheus, give or take half a star. It is a direct sequel to Prometheus, set a decade after the events in that film, and it reveals the ultimate fate of Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, the android David (Michael Fassbender), and the aliens that created the bioweapon that they encountered in Prometheus. Or at least, some of those aliens. It is not made clear if they found the planet of origin or just another colony. This hardly matters to the events in Covenant though, so I don't think you could consider it a spoiler.Covenant picks up the story with a colony ship bound for Origae 6. The ship - named Covenant - is under way with all the colonists and crew in cryosleep, and the ship being cared for by the AI Mother and an android named Walter (also played by Michael Fassbender). The ship's journey is interrupted by a mishap, wakening the crew and causing them to be in the right time and place to get a transmission of a ghostly human voice singing a pop song in English. I wonder who that could be? They decide to investigate and trouble ensues. I won't get into the details of that too much except to say that when the action begins it is fabulously gory, there are some spooky atmospherics (though nowhere near as spooky as anything in the first two films), and there is a lot of genuine suspense generated at one point when you realize you are not sure if you're looking at Walter or David.There are also some horror movie cliches at work. It's not a horror movie if a character isn't making the dumbest choice available to them, and it's not an Alien movie unless that choice is sticking their face up next to a place where their face should not go.There are some themes grounding this movie that show a master director is at work. The religious motifs and corporate motifs are skillfully handled, and there is an underlying suggestion that the stronger the drive to create is, then the stronger the drive to destroy will be. Even the full knowledge that what is created will ultimately become contemptuous of its creator does not stop the cycle.All in all, Covenant is a good entree in the series, but the first two films remain the standard.","4.0 "

Here's the good news! If you saw Aliens, there is absolutely no reason to see this movie because this movie, Alien Covenant, is almost the same movie as Aliens. Some slight differences. But basically the same. The heroine even kind of looks like Sigourney Weaver, circa 1986.This movie does not need to exist. It was done very well in the previous iteration (Aliens) and the only reason to do yet another Alien movie would be to do something different, interesting or unique with the characters or the story. Absolutely nothing suspenseful happens in this movie - you will not be scared or even startled at all, most likely - because literally everything that we see has happened before, in other Alien movies. Face huggers jump on someone's face! The blood-acid melts some stuff! The android crew member goes off the rails and kills people! They blow the alien into space!For real. Just skip it.

"Alien: Covenant","Oh Please, You Can't Call This An Alien Movie","Blahblahblah","This is a very disappointing movie, due entirely to the director. The Aliens grow faster than you can inflate a balloon. The highly trained colonists can't deal with anything, can't figure out anything, can't shoot straight, and spend most of their time whining or asking for help. The graphics were great, the actors looked fine -- ordinary people not pretties, but none of that made any difference. I really don't see the motivation for the androids, nor for the Creators (who apparently survive but all live in one city and are even more stupid than the human colonists), nor for the director. Clearly, who ever did the good parts of the original Alien wasn't this director. Modern directors seem blinded by graphics tricks or else don't really do anything at all. Maybe financiers insist on their own particular bits of crap? Is the director no more than a name plate? Prometheus had many of the same faults, but it didn't seem as stupid.Note, I saw this movie on cable (group watch) but I review it here on Amazon.","1.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","Sometimes More is Less","KJAG","“Covenant” follows up as a sequel to “Prometheus” 10 years after.  Standing on its own merits, this is a pretty good sci-fi flick.  But serious fans of the franchise will likely find it a bit disappointing, as Ridley Scott fails again to reach near the bar he set so high with the original classic, “Alien,” (followed closely by James Cameron’s “Aliens”).  Unfortunately for Scott, he set the bar so high that many devoted franchise followers have very high expectations for any new addition.  Scott found this out with Prometheus, with many fans and critics left scratching their heads and panning the film.  He then tried to address what he got wrong by serving up Covenant not long after.Covenant nicely ties up loose ends from Prometheus, is less confusing, and brings back the traditional Aliens, along with other dangers, including a clever plot twist.  However, this film still deviates from Scott’s own successful movie-making formula, which made both “Alien” and his “Bladerunner” sci-fi classics.In an unapologetic movie introduction, Scott indicates he intended for this to be a sci-fi horror flick filled with suspense like his original movie, only magnified.  But it doesn’t quite work because guess what?  We don’t care enough about the large majority of characters in this film to feel their emotions and pain, and the movie is missing other key ingredients that made his earlier films stand out.  More threats, action, special effects, impressive sets, cinematography, and new gruesome ways to die (sci-fi staples that today’s audiences already expect) do not alone make for a satisfying story, which is the heart of his previous classics.  And all of it is compressed into a measly 2 hours.WHAT’S RIGHT1. (ACTION, DEATH, AND DESTRUCTION) There is plenty for fans who love it.  In fact, it dominates the movie.  The pace is fast and furious, and the dangers and death come in various forms and fashions, on the planet and in space.2. (PLOT) The plot lines for the most part are excellent.  The movie starts out much like the first Alien film, with the crew detecting an “intelligent” signal from an unknown world.  But instead of being ordered to investigate, it’s their choice to investigate or not.  Much of the movie is then focused on the crew’s efforts to survive as most become stranded on the planet (like “Aliens”) and are overwhelmed by multiple types of threats that come at them from all sides before they have time to process them.  The few survivors who make it back to the ship then find the nightmare is not over.  The movie does an excellent job of answering what happened to Dr. Shaw and David from Prometheus, as well as the Engineers.  It also explains the origins of the traditional Alien species, which is quite surprising.  And there is a surprising plot twist that involves Artificial Intelligence (AI) that harkens to the genius of Scott, and sets up the next movie in the franchise quite well (if there is one).3. (ACTING) Michael Fassbender was excellent in Prometheus, but outdoes himself in Covenant playing two different android models, with differing personalities and agendas.  Kathy Waterston is also excellent as the one crew member with some sense who is initially disregarded, then takes matters into her own hands—a common theme in the franchise.  She is convincing as the heroine here as well, although the movie is half over before she becomes interesting.4. (SPECIAL EFFECTS, SETS, AND CINEMATOGRAPHY) Overall very good and at times impressive, but some notable CGI misfires (read on).WHAT’S WRONG1. (WHO CARES?) Aside from Fassbender (dual roles) and Waterston, the rest of the Covenant characters are mostly forgettable—a combination of drab writing, mediocre direction, and some questionable casting choices.  The characters are under-developed and relatively bland, and we don’t really get to know them on a personal level like the crews in the first two movies of the franchise.  Like Prometheus, there is little bonding between characters, and too few characters that are genuinely likeable or even interesting.  Mostly boring dialogue and unconvincing acting doesn’t help, which is surprising, since the director has so much control over this.  The result is that we don’t care enough about their fear, suffering, or grisly demise to resonate very high on our empathy or emotional scales.  (If you’re a devoted fan of the Jason, Freddy, or Michael movie franchises, or Alien 3—then you won’t care about this).2. (APPRECIATE WHAT GOT YOU HERE RIDLEY) Also lacking—a memorable score and sound effects, and the dramatic pauses that all created a palpable sense of isolation, dread, suspense, and fright in the original Alien (and Bladerunner).  Also grossly absent—a satisfying ending (unless you’re again a fan of Alien 3).3. (C’MON MAN!) As some excoriating reviewers have noted, a number of blunders are just not realistic for a crew responsible for the safety of 2000 passengers, equipment probably worth hundreds of $Billions in today’s dollars, and a mission that is other than routine:  A. Determining the gaseous makeup of a planet’s atmosphere (O2, CO2, etc.), radiation and temp’s, and “known” hazardous elements and compounds is realistic and expected prior to landing.  What is not—putting 3/4 of the crew on a new planet without respiratory or suit protection against possible unknown spores, pollens, bacteria, molds, viruses, and hazardous substances that you can’t realistically identify or assess beforehand.  B.  The ship’s 2nd in-command, who quickly becomes #1, is too incompetent and devoid of leadership skills and common sense.  Scott tries to get around this by indicating these are the reasons why he wasn’t selected #1—but it doesn’t work, as he shouldn’t have been #2, or in any command position to begin with.  After a series of costly blunders, he is then (thankfully) convinced to literally stick his face into an Alien pod by someone who has already demonstrated obvious suspicion.  C.  Somehow organic creatures (not traditional Aliens) evolve in less than an hour (crew’s time) from spores inside a human to fully functional and intelligent creatures that break out of the poor hosts, then somehow are able to absorb multiple gun blasts with little or no ill effect despite being totally organic.  (Maybe a bit more believable if they were robots, semi-robots, or giants, which they are not).4. (FRANCHISE INCONSISTENCIES):  The original “Alien” movie shows the crew finding the Alien pods in the bay of an Engineer’s ship with a dead Engineer at the controls.  However, this “prequel” Covenant contradicts this by establishing that A:  The Alien species (and their pods) originated from the planet the Covenant crew lands on (which is apparently the Engineers’ home planet), and B:  the Aliens and their pods originated after the Engineers on the planet were wiped out (and the planet left uninhabitable).5. (NOT SO SPECIAL EFFECTS) Like many newer movies, there is often over-use of CGI, to the point of being detrimental.  There are times that actual physical props and creative physical effects simply work better than CGI, and that sometimes less is more (e.g., “Alien” and “Jaws.”)  The best movies find the proper balance.  While most of the special effects are very good, some of the CGI is noticeably cheesy, and at times even cartoonish, especially for Aliens and other creatures in their appearance and movements.","3.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","I was sorely disappointed. Prometheus had a lot of flaws","truereview","I had high hopes when this movie first came out. However, I was sorely disappointed. Prometheus had a lot of flaws, but in many ways it was a beautiful movie to watch. This movie has way too many flaws to make it enjoyable. For starters, the crew land on a planet that wasn't as heavily researched as their original planet, but don't put on any sort of bio-suits to protect them for whatever may be lurking on the planet. Before I list anymore problems with the movie, I need to say that I am an avid sic-fi and horror fan. The first 2 Alien movies were very good. I've seen them several times. I've even seen Prometheus several times. This, however, is not in the same league as any of the ones I mentioned.Okay, the crew goes wandering around without any sort of bio-suits and someone gets infected. What;s the solution? Well, bring them aboard the ship without any safeguards. I would think that you wouldn't want to take the chance of infecting anyone else. But, what do I know? Later, the captain (if I remember correctly) sees David (the android form Prometheus) communicating with one of the Aliens, with a crew ember lying dead near them. The captain then lets David lead him to a lower level and walk amongst some pods. Oh, I forgot to mention, David told the crew that the Aliens won't come where he took then as a refuge. So...you see David talking to one of the Aliens in the refuge he told you they couldn't enter, with one of your fellow crew members dead near them, and you still follow him as he holds a conversation with you? It doesn't make any sense. The captain, of course, while standing amidst the pods and talking to David, is attacked by a face hugger. Did I mention that David convinces him to look into the pod? Again, this is after he has clear proof that David lied to him and his crew. I'm giving this 2 stars because it looks pretty good. This was a huge disappointment!","2.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","It's not nearly as bad as the reviews would lead you to believe.","Karl P","Yes, it's a very different film than the previous entries of the series, with themes that would seem, at first, out of place in the Alien franchise. But if you consider some of the novels and graphic novels set in the expanded universe, Alien: Covenant would not seem that odd.As in Prometheus, there are some hasty/stupid decisions by the crew of the Covenant, and the writing can be just a bit ""off"" in some places, but it's much improved over the previous installment. Overall I thought it was a good film, and worthy of it's place in the series. And it bridges more of the gap in the story between the prequels and the original Scott film satisfactorily.Visually, as par for the franchise, the movie is striking. The set pieces and creature designs are very well done. And the tension and sense of dread doesn't let up throughout the film.Bottom line: If you enjoy the Alien series and care about how all the events tie together, watch it. If you're interested in the Ancient Astronaut motif, like tense sci-fi horror, and can appreciate a little philosophy mixed in, watch it. You'll find that the reviews and aggregate scores don't tell the whole of it.","4.0 "

A badly developed plot reminiscent of a B movie production with highly implausible events strung together loosely reminiscent of a movie with a mindless bunch of teenagers (metaphorically speaking) engaging in highly unlikely random behavior on an unsurveyed planet they happen upon once again due to a random signal received.  All familiar and regurgitated themes make this a poor yet big movie (huge production budget) in the franchise and also very, very long with little or no new elements to hold your attention and no other artistic qualities at all.

What a disappointment Covenant is!! What was the main issue for me? I did not care about any of the characters in this movie. Did not care who they were or what happened to them. The one character whose fate I wanted to know about is not in the movie. I would love to know why the creators of this movie thought that the viewers would be so interested in the robot that we would want a whole movie about him. David was an interesting character in Prometheus but he was not who we were rooting for.

"Alien: Covenant","COUNTRY ROADS TAKE ME HOME TO THE PLACE I BELONG","The Movie Guy","This film follows ""Prometheus"" by a decade (2104). The spaceship Covenant is traveling to a colony on Origae, 15 crew members, 2000 colonists, 1140 embryos,  when they are disrupted by a neutrino burst being too close to a solar flare. They recover and get a signal from a nearby planet, very similar to Earth. Given the option of exploring this new planet or spending seven more years in cryosleep, they opt to explore, and discover the Prometheus. Aliens follow.This is certainly not the sequel I expected. The only character introduction was David (Michael Fassbender) and artificial intelligence who asks, ""Who created you?""  to his human creator. Yes, that was so deep. The aliens, spaceship, killing and explosions were all decent. Character build up didn't exist. If you are traveling in deep space to another star system, you most likely won't travel near any star, let alone two of them.The neutrino burst had me scratching my head. Neutrinos are mass-less particles that rarely interact with matter. They are extremely difficult to detect without using huge amounts of shielding to eliminate gamma ray interference....which is why the research in done inside mine shafts deep in the earth. If you are close enough to a supernova to be effected by neutrinos, you are already vaporized, Thus having a neutrino detector on a space ship, even if you could construct one, would be useless. That neutrino line was one might expect in a 1950's sci-fi film or maybe it was done as a joke as homage to bad films.Guide: F-word (about 2 dozen or so) near sex and nudity near end. 3 1/2 stars","4.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","~ Review for DIGIBOOK Edition w/Slipcover, Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy ~","93Vet","Picking up after the events of PROMETHEUS, to a degree, we see another ship, THE COVENANT, encounter ""David"", the robot who had his head severed from his body at the end of ""Pro.."". The new crew, carrying ""colonists"", ends up coming into contact with the dreaded ""alien species"" after they discover a signal and go to investigate. Not the wisest move if you have over 2,000 colonists on board your ship. But, the crew does go and investigate. They have a robot of their own, a virtual identical ""look"" if you will, as David. David being programmed by Mr. Weyland, has a nasty reputation to survive at any cost.He likes the ""Alien"" species, much like that of the robot in the very first ALIEN movie that almost kills Ripley.I agree with another reviewer here, there is no happiness in this movie. The ending is, well, left open for another one, of course.I won't tell you what it is exactly here, but I do like this movie much better than that of the horrific ""Ressurection"" and ""Alien 3"" where Ripley finds herself stranded on a prison planet with known rapists and murderers trying to find their ""inner peace"".I truly wish Ms. Weaver would have done another one years ago where the new ALIEN movie began with her ""Escape craft"" being picked up once again in outer space. The ""writers"" could portray that she had been in cryogenic for 75 years, give or take a few, and that she dreamed the events in Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection.  That is my take on it anyway.Packaging here for this movie is pretty neat. A Target Exclusive, it comes with a nice Digibook, with some great photos of the movie, the Blu-ray and DVD of the movie, Digital copy and Slipcover.The 4K disc is sold in another package. Marketing folks, more $$.  I didn't pay what this site is asking, either.

"Alien: Covenant","Studio execs stole Ridley Scott's vision, and provided a mediocre movie by comittee","Marcos","This will be a long review.My issue, it has problems with the preceding Alien flicks, and the big surprise is the lack of continuity of themes from Prometheus.Problem 1:While the original chest burster scene is a classic of cinematography, the ""around the table with everyone"" setting caused the creature to run away with ""inexplicable fast growth"", IFG for short, for the remainder of that movie, rather than having a lone guy chest bursting allowing for the creature to eat the dead body and further grow as it ate the other crew members.  In Prometheus IFG was even worse with the trilobite, and by this movie I'm just grown tired of IFG and the ""I believe"" button no longer works for me when the Aliens grow so fast to full adults < 24 hours with no apparent food intake after bursting.  There's 0 reason to not have the movie take place over a longer timespan to lessen the IFG.  The Aliens also lack clear patterns and motivations other than killing, even at the risk of their own lives.  Even in the original Alien at some points the Alien was shown sleeping, not here.Problem 2:If you read the blogosphere leading from Prometheus to the release of this movie, you'll find out the movie changed title twice, and with it the direction of the movie, from Prometheus 2 Paradise to Alien Paradise and finally to Alien Covenant, in fact the original plot wholly excluded the original Xenomorph Aliens and centered in moving the story arc forward from Prometheus.  The fact of removing Prometheus and Paradise both from the title reflect studio meddling of Scott's ideas because despite Prometheus's success they desired to distance this latest outing from that movie due to its mixed reviews.  So we have a movie that in one sense tries to be a sequel to another movie while at the same time trying to distance itself from it, causing bizarre and hard to believe plot twists, specially the one with Prometheus's main character of Elizabeth Shaw.Problem 3:The trailer gave too much away.  They shouldn't even have shown the new Alien's physiology in the trailer.  When I watched the movie, there was literally only one way to move the story into those scenes shown.  Too many key scenes were ruined, suspense was reduced thanks to poor trailer scene selection.Problem 4:Same ending.  I don't want to give too much away, but let's just say if you've seen Alien, Aliens, and Prometheus you can sort of predict the where, when, who, and how for the end of the movie.  Sure there's a twist, but it's one a blind man can see coming.  So rather than provide the same ending again with a predictable twist, a wholly different type of ending would have done wonders.","3.0 "

There are a few circumstances when you would watch it: 1.  You are in a full body cast and cannot do anything except watch movies2.  You are able to watch it free; 3.  There is an active nuclear attack occurring outside your home and you cannot go outside and pull weeds from your lawn instead.But seriously, when people were discussing concepts for the movie, what happened?  What happened to the creativity, continuity of story from prior films in the franchise?  What happened to delving deep, thinking of something new and interesting?  Did someone's teenage son read a stolen copy of the script and ask their parent ""Is this really all you guys could come up with after all the great movies before?""  or maybe, ""Dude, too much human junk, not enough aliens!""What happened with the aliens?

Prometheus kind of lacked that horror feel and had more of a wonder and adventure feel to it.  This is a movie for Halloween I guess.The major problem here is that the writers just forgot who this movie was for.  It was for fans of the prior movies.

"Alien: Covenant","Ship of Fools","Night Reader","SPOILERS AHEAD:I don't really care about the ""Alien"" canon or the Prometheus origin story, but I do expect the writers to have some respect for the viewers and make the characters believable, and their actions logical. Alas, in the first 30 minutes of the movie that simple request is ignored, setting the tone for the entire movie. This is my second viewing of Covenant and I'm having trouble getting beyond the 30-minute mark, so my commentary will have to stop there.- The movie starts, and the Covenant's captain, played by James Franco, is immediately killed in some sort of space storm - a small mercy there because Franco would be insufferable in this movie.- The ship's second in command is played by Billy Crudup, a wimpy guy who isn't ready for command. Why would Weyland-Yutani approve someone so wimpy and stupid to be second in command of a risky mission like this? The answer is they wouldn't. And Crudup, like most of this movie's actors is miscast. I'm tired of his deer-in-the-headlights acting schtick.- So, the crew is woken up and decides they don't want to go back into hypersleep for the 7 years required to complete the original mission. Crudup and crew abandon years of detailed logistical planning, jeopardize the 2000 colonists in cryosleep, and head to a new destination revealed by a random distress signal.- They divert their ship towards the signal and launch a landing ship to investigate the planet. Why they don't reconnoiter the distress beacon before landing is baffling. Also, a quick aerial survey of the planet's surface would have shown them the Engineer's city covered in dead bodies. That might have been an important clue. Instead they land 8 miles away from the distress signal and send out the entire crew, less one, to find the signal source. Of course, there's no protective gear on the search party, but they do bother to take weapons. I suppose if they were willing to scrap years of new-colony planning on a hunch, and not survey the planet from orbit before landing, then wearing protective gear when first exploring a new planet would seem to be overly cautious.- On the hike to the signal source, two search party members drop out to check out a nearby mud bog - Crudup is OK with splitting up his team, one of whom is his wife. One of these people stops to take a smoke break and is immediately infected by an alien spore. So W-Y would allow cigarettes to be hauled across the galaxy, and a highly trained, new-colony crew-member would be a smoker, and a stupid one at that? This is a prime example of Covenant's writer's laziness. The movie's writers compound the already overwhelming lethality of the xenomorphs with the forced incompetence of the crew, and it sucks all the suspense out of the movie. The writers of ""Alien"" agonized over how the alien creature could get on to the Nostromo, and then they gave the crew a fighting chance to survive. Is it asking too much of the Covenant's writers to make the crew's actions plausible?- Within 60 seconds, a second member of the search party sticks his face up close to an alien plant and is also spore-infected. At least this victim could blame his stupidity on excessive curiosity - maybe he was a botanist back home.- Why Walter, the ship's android, doesn't exert some AI common sense and warn the crew to be careful is another unexplained mystery. Fassbender gets the credit for being the only compelling actor in this movie. Maybe so, but I'm not seeing it.- At this point it's obvious the entire crew will be cannon-fodder, and I lost interest in whether they lived or died.- Thats it for the movie's first 30 minutes or so - extremely frustrating because the visuals are so gorgeous. But the movie's casting and screenplay are a huge letdown. I know I'm being picky about details here, but details are what made ""Alien"" a classic. Ridley - please find someone new to write these stories, and do what you do best - direct and compose beautiful scenes.","2.0 "

That may sound gross, however, it was always the best part of the movie for me!. The cyborg evolving into its own creative mind was very thought-provoking and realistic. Walter and David may be robots made in the image of mankind and one can only expect such an evolutionary outcome of a free-thinking robot! I loved that idea, despite David's tragic invention of his past time zoology project! The next thing I loved about the movie was that I always thought Sigourney Weaver could never be replaced! But I was pleasantly surprised at the charisma Katherine Waterston had in replacing her role in this movie!. She was awesome! I also thought all the crew members' were flawless in their actinig! I study facial expressions and the fear expressions were brilliant!What I didn't like was the fact that the crew didn't wear protective clothing or gear when they ventured out into a new world! Rather a basic scientific principle despite ""mother"" predicting the world to have a safe environment and atmosphere. Where was the botanist in the crew! No one bothered to caution the team about the new world or its surface. I wasn't a fan of the alien standing upright, it had a more human look to it than the original alien.

"Alien: Covenant","Only part way home, hopefully more to come in a big epic conclusion to Ridley Scotts new story.","Zac DeG","A relatively good entry between Prometheus and the first 'Alien'. There certainly needs to be a bigger more grand entry to connect the prequels to the original and I am hopeful Fox will green light that and not leave it hanging out there unfinished. Though there are differences from pure Alien devotees and those who enjoy Prometheus. I so far am fine with how the story is evolving and the really cool concept as to where AI (Artificial Intelligence) is taking us. This was more like an episode rather than a movie and that holds it back just a bit. Characters could have been fleshed out more and David and Walter are by far the main focus. I really want to see something big happen wherever the ship is heading to and something remarkable from that idea.

This is a very good film!  the same basic characters- a humanoid, self-determining women,  and boys with hats.  the monsters are better, or just ss good as the first time you met them.  the subtext of god creating man creating monsters creating monsters...that kind of thing,  that is thrilling but only if life goes on and humans can fight it out.  my only disappointment was the ending,  I like happy endings -  like Alien 4 - two girls,  one a robot and one an alien mutant,  finally make it back to earth.","4.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","Enough!","suzietoo","The high tech used in this movie is breathtaking and there are enough scenes that made my skin crawl. But I regret to say that there was virtually no character development, which was lost in blood and gore.  Yes, it's different in that we have two synthetics that look alike and a touching scene in the beginning, but not enough for even three stars. I hope they have now laid to rest any more Alien movies.","1.0 "

Honestly I was expecting more but after rewatching a couple times this is a great add to the series and does fill some gaps missing in the overall story.  What most people probably didn't like about the movie (spoiler alert) there is absolutely no happiness in this film.  The ending even has no satisfaction to it, but if you take it for what it is and just love the overall story between all the film's than you will mist likely enjoy it like I did.","4.0 "

Without her this prequel is incredibly boring and flat. It just drags and drags. Linking it back to Promethus is contrived and irrelevant. I hung in for an hour ofabout 2 hours hoping it might get better which never happened. Time sure moves slow during a bad movie.  There is no memorable actor in the film all forgettable and for me waste of an evening and $6. Not recommended probably soon available for free anyway. This film is a true dog.

"Alien: Covenant","PROMETHEUS 2 MY ASS!!!!!!!!!!!","Brodie B. Hoffman","At the end of 2016, the media put out a brief summary of exciting new movies that would be released during the following year (2017). I cannot tell you how excited I was, when they announced that PROMETHEUS 2 was going to be release! I was a big fan of the first movie that came out in 2012, PROMETHEUS. The way the original movie ended, made it absolutely perfect for a sequel. Why was I so excited?* Going to see the surviving woman, and ""David"" (the droid) actually go to the planet of our ""makers"".* Going to see what their world looked like, and learn more about this civilization.* Going to watch these alien-creatures unleashed upon them, as they had planned to unleash upon us.* Going to finally find out why it is that they wanted to destroy humankind, when they were the ones that made us.The possibilities were absolutely endless. I thought to myself, finally, Ridley Scott is moving past the same old ""Aliens"" story line, that had been played over, and over again, in order to create something truly unique again.....All that I can say is........WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!! NOT A SINGLE THING I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO WITH THIS MOVIE HAPPENED!!!!! A TOTAL CREATIVE-COP-OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SHAME ON YOU RIDLEY SCOTT FOR MISLEADING US BY ANNOUNCING THE RELEASE OF PROMETHEUS 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT A LIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Do you know what is so ironic?? As 2017 was coming to end, it finally dawned on me. Hold on a second. I have not heard a damn thing about Prometheus 2!?!?!? I still have the article in which it was announced. Totally perplexed, I started doing some research. To my absolute dismay, I discovered that there was no Prometheus 2. Instead, it had been named ""ALIEN COVENANT"". I thought, well, OK, I don't care if the name changed, so long as the story is good. NO SUCH LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie is a total cop-out. It does not address ANY OF THE QUESTIONS that were raised in Prometheus. This movie could have been amazing; but, I guess Ridley Scott has lost all creativity. This STUPID MOVIE is nothing but a re-tread of all of the other movies he has ALREADY CREATED DECADES AGO!!!!Sorry Ridley, but you failed miserably. Worse yet, you disappointed your fans, like me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","1.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","Time to put the franchise to bed","Brian","While 2017's 'Alien: Covenant' is not exactly a barnburner of a sci-fi/horror adventure (hampered story-and-suspense-wise by the writers' efforts to tie in too many silly premises established by its hopelessly bloated predecessor 'Prometheus'), it's a hell of a lot more fun to sit through than the franchise's other post-'Aliens' sequels.  The characters are largely undeveloped, narrative is familiar and there are plot holes.  But production values are good, acting decent and the antics of this round's doomed space travelers move along quickly-- although at times implausibly-- largely avoiding the abject stupidity of their Promethean antecedents.  3-plus stars.  Still, Fox, Ridley, please no more.","3.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","It's a Mixed Bag","Nikolas P. Robinson","Alien: Covenant would have perhaps not disappointed me if I hadn't gone in with high hopes and expecting something that would have served as a bridge between Prometheus and Alien.Don't get me wrong, because this is a good movie, better than Prometheus and better than both Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection, but it isn't at all what I sincerely hoped it could be.A third movie will be necessary with these movies, and some serious suspension of disbelief or absolutely amazing storytelling would be required to make these narratives fall in line with Alien or Aliens. I can't exactly explain why it does anything but create a bridge (and, if anything, creates more of a distance between these events and the beginning of Alien), because that would be rife with spoilers. I can say that, if you were concerned about Prometheus not fitting into the universe of Alien, you will feel even more of those sentiments here.If I hadn't spent my adolescence reading the various Alien comic books published by Dark Horse, some of this disappointment wouldn't be present...but it isn't just that. This is a fantastic movie, well-executed and well-written, but it just left me feeling like something was missing or like Ridley Scott doesn't bother with continuity checks on his own work.","3.0 "

Mind you, I'm someone who actually likes Alien 3 and who thought Resurrection just needed a better final 10 minutes to be decent, so it's not like I ask for much from an Alien film. Yet, somehow, this still failed to deliver.It's not suspenseful. The action is B-movie grade at best. Its big plot twist was so hamfistedly handled that it was obvious what was going to happen before they even finished setting it up. And, I know what you're thinking: ""Well, at least this one will have a xenomorph in it, instead of the big baddie just being deadly smoke."" That's true. It does.

The movie disposes of the Shaw character from the movie, as well as the engineers in order to move away from that story line, which was a ham fisted move. (Think Alien 3 and the killing off of Hicks and Newt). Ridley Scott also lifted an element from Alien vs. Predator by having the newly hatched xenomorphs grow to full size in a matter of minutes. The funniest part of the movie was when the xenomorph was on the shuttle dodging bullets. How does it know what a gun is or bullets for that matter? Alien Covenant was disappointing. Ridley Scott dropped the ball.","1.0 "

I found the alien civilization more interesting than the killer aliens, it would be nice if the author(s) created a movie in that direction without the need for the common violence commonly associated with the alien saga which was good for the 80's but its getting tiring.

"Alien: Covenant","Going down in flames, 5 by 5","Brian","Alien Covenant continues to crush the incredible mythology it created during one of the greatest horror franchises of all time. Not even the token resistances from Prometheus are present as Ridley Scott ruins both the Engineers and the creation of the Aliens themselves.Even Michael Fassbender can do little except to add a few bright points in terms of acting, bringing both the surprisingly human Walter and the borderline Lecter-like David 8 to life. I can't comment on any other character because they were so bland and paper thin they might as well have all been androids.But the clichéd tropes aren't so much repeated as regurgitated: blowing up their own ship, not taking the slightest precautions on an alien world but still going armed to the teeth, assuming the air is safe to breathe and plants safe to touch, and not bothering to observe quarantine or return to ship protocols. Everything about the lore and back story is functionally ruined before even the third act, and is based on the flimsiest of motivations.","1.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","It's time for a new generation of writers and directors to make the next Alien movie","Sheriff Buford T. Justice","In Alien (1979) there were 7 crew members who got picked off one by one. We could relate to and understand them as humans (except for Ash). Covenant had too many people with non existent personalities. What made Alien (1979) so tragic was that there was no way out of the ship, except of course at the end where Ripley jettisons herself out into space with her cat. Covenant had no real sense of inevitable doom. The haunted house creepiness never came to be. It's a shame though.  From what I've been reading on the web, there may not be any more installments as Covenant just didn't pull in enough money. This franchise needs newer and younger writers and directors to even consider making a new Alien movie. The next one must be so creative, so filled with unexpected surprises, that no one, and I mean no one could possibly figure out what will happen next. That's the next Alien movie for me.","3.0 "

Something is clearly wrong as they discover the fate of the first crew.

"Alien: Covenant","A good solid film and helps to start building the bridge from Prometheus and the originals, but also stands well on its own.","Joseph Besherwor","A very interesting addition to the series. Many people will have nostalgic feeling for the first two Alien movies (Alien and Aliens) and will never be satisfied by anything that will come since then, but don't let them dissuade you, Alien Covenant feel like what Prometheus should have been. I enjoyed Prometheus as a stand along science fiction movie but it lacked the feel of Alien and Aliens (and maybe Alien 3). I attribute that to the fact that Prometheus had to do some world building to set the stage for Ridley Scotts next two movies after it. With Alien Covenant being chapter 2 of the  Alien prequel trilogy it was able to start bridging the gap between these new movies and the original ones. Without giving away spoilers I will add that the horror elements that made the original so memorable. The story feels like it fits into the world that was established in the original and later fleshed out with Aliens, Alien 3 and Prometheus while still giving you new places and people to make it its own. Hardcore fans of the series well like the connections being made, personally I cant wait to see how it all comes together in the next movie.The causal viewers will also, though I would recommend watching Prometheus just to get more of little story details. All in all I would recommend this movie and I think too many people unrealistically critical of this movie, just because its not the original or the sequel to the original.","4.0 "

Thanks eveyone, you guys saved me money because I waited until I could watch this for free! So a round of thanks to all.My two cents will be short, others have eloquently hit all the relevant points. For me, Aliens was a beloved childhood film. I hated 3 and 4. I honestly enjoyed Prometheus as a stand alone sci-fi movie. If it were not for Fassbender, I prob would not have bothered to watch this one... but good grief this movie was dullllll!!!!! Ugh!! I found myself speeding up through scenes.Also, seriously? A space mission and the crew is made up of people who have the attitude of college kids trapped in a cabin? You know the stereotypical trope that we all know by now, but apparently Ridley Scott has not seen. Maybe they can't get quality crews to man these missions. I could see that, the company might recruit criminals who were given a choice: prison or space. They were like a suicide squad :P. But honestly though, there is even a horror cliche of shower sex. I was rooting for these morons to die.The worst thing for me was the clear attempt to rip off Ripley (Aliens). It struck me when the not-ripley woman was wearing the same tank top, cross shoulder harness, sweat stains and short hair. From behind it just hit soooo blatantly. It made this whole thing worse, it became a lazy rip off.I get the attempt to make something unique and misfiring. I know a lot of people hated Prometheus, but even with all the flaws it was trying to be something. Here it felt like Ridley was told: you can't just have Michael Fassbender chat about spores and poetry. So Ridley said: ok, let's take the second movie that they loved so much and give them what they want. Boy- did he miss the mark! Did he miss this big time.

The ending wasn't exactly a surprise, and some of it seemed a bit rushed. Elizabeth Shaw's fate was a bit disappointing, (her only screen time was as a hologram and as something that resembled hamburger helper) and so was the overall brief appearance of the Engineers.(I still don't understand how the entire planet of advanced beings let themselves get snuffed out by their own weapon.I mean, they just stood there and let the Nazi death robot take them all out. Surely one of them, at some time or another, sat down and thought, ""Yup. We might wanna plan for something like that. We left a whole bunch of that crap out there on another planet."" Capable of interstellar travel, but can't see the obvious coming.)  I also hope that Walters fate, as well as whatever remains on the Engineer's home world isn't just left a mystery. It seemed that they tried too hard to make Walter a character we could care about, as well as his ability to resist David's attempt to kill him, to just X him out, and the planet itself is still there with all the same dangers as when the survivors left it. The Albino Aliens and the Xenomorph's screen time could have been longer. This is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars.

(One knocks a dudes jaw clean off with its tail and another straight up bites off a chicks head. Awesome!) Fassbender did a great job as David and as Walter. It was cool, yet kind of frustrating, cheering for and hating two different characters played by the same guy.When the Xenomorph finally appears, it is awesome. The visual effects gave it a different, but more realistic look and made its movements look better than I have ever seen in any previous Alien movie. The story line was good, visually stunning, great action, and just an overall damn good and entertaining sci-fi movie. Definitely recommend watching it.","4.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","Worthy.","william","It goes on the shelf with the other alien movies. Definitely collectible. Better than the precursor, but not the same caliber as Aliens of course. True Alien fans will enjoy this movie in spite of it's flaws. The most notable thing would be the sheer malevolence of the creatures in this movie. Their viciousness and  predation has been raised to a new level. In the past I viewed these creations with a healthy dislike as they terrorized and violently attacked any humans who were unfortunate enough to venture too near. This new breed is nothing short of vile. They are to be despised. I love the hateful mayhem they dish out so readily..Well done. I'm ready for the next one.","4.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","This was a satisfying episode in the story of Alien","John","This was absolutely EXCELLENT!I read a lot of reviews where there is anger towards the writers about the stupid decisions made and I have to say:1.  Don't forget where this episode lies in the storyline.  It is after Prometheus, where no one knows ANYTHING, so they are not prepared for anything like this.2. They were trained for one mission and one mission only - no deviation.  When deviation happened, they were immediately out of their depth.3. Couples were common, which made default decisions based on emotions (see #2 above).4. The audience watching knows what will happen in certain circumstances, which makes some scenes incredibly frustrating to watch - but again - the characters know nothing...It is easy to get angry at so many bad decisions, but to make the full circle complete - to where it all started for us with original Alien - it is important to remember that there was no general knowledge of this alien life.  In the first Alien movie, there was no knowledge (except possible from Weyland Corp), and how did so much happen, with the info NOT getting back to the general population??Prometheus was the beginning, with this episode explaining even more.Can't WAIT for the next one, so i can put more puzzle pieces together!","5.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","In space...no one can hear you roll your eyes.","Well_Poet","In part I enjoyed this reboot-sequel-add on- uh...thing. That part being cool aliens that eviscerate dumb humans in new and creative ways paired with really cool looking deep space and deep spaceship effects. I've always been a fan of the Alien movies, even as they go off the rails now and again and seem to get confused on where the heck they are going...in space. Picture, if you will, those street signs with 8 arrows pointing every which way. Alien: Covenant is no exception to this vaguely convoluted double back approach. They did it with Ripley clones and resurrections, now they are doing it with the android David....sorry David...synthetic person. Unlike a few complaints I've heard, I do actually follow where this franchise is trying to go, even as it changes direction, looks at it's feet for ten minutes, and circles back. I get the connections, the tie in's, all that...it's actually pretty simple to me. Perhaps years of sorting through all this and watching every film several times unravels this a little easier. My main gripe here is the same as the others in many ways, even as I like them. As the movies parade forth, the characters and the plot developments get more inane and repetitive. The production values get more impressive at least. Although not quite the grandeur and scope of monumental stupidity in character form of Prometheus, we have quite a few moments here that make up for it in extra stylish dumb people style. It all seems to stem from the first film, sending one guy at a time armed with a flame thrower into narrow corridors to battle it out with a impossibly vicious alien that seems to be impervious to pretty much everything...including space and fire. Only that seemed cool somehow in a fresh new crazy dumb way back in the 80's, because well, what choice did they have to keep this movie exciting? Where as the more recent rapid fire brand of this plot malfunction unloaded until empty on the audience feels a wee bit obligatory to downright silly. The thought being more is just...more...I guess. In the latest installment we have this sort of approach in visually stunning spades. ""Should we do this incredibly stupid thing?"" then ""No I protest"" then ""OK sure, yeah let's do that incredibly stupid thing, stupider though"" Hey, it's all part of the fun and exciting cliche psuedo-philosophical thrill ride involving the folly of human arrogance, stupidity, etc. A fresh if leftover illustration, still barely warm for the microwave. I think I got it though, not sure I need this many examples in one place anymore. How about just making the aliens so truly ridiculously badass, that even logical solutions fail entirely? Might be fun for a reboot reboot. As this making the aliens cooler looking in CGI, yet less effective to powerless, and the now more effective crew damning itself entirely through all dumb choices is a little heavy handed at this point. I mean humans are stupid for sure, but are we really all that stupid as to have every plot twist based upon that characteristic? Well, I suppose I'm one stupid enough to enjoy this film a little anyway.","3.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","The Three Stooges in Space - dumb gets dumber.","P. Miller","Why don't these writers/directors understand that they just can't write a sci-fi plot without sound scientific underpinnings?  Audiences are too knowledgeable and scientifically sophisticated to accept this nonsense excuse for a sci-fi horror. This Alien film is just about as stupid as it gets.  It's simply not enough to focus solely on the gore; a film like this has to make sense to be respectable.  Everything going in this installment of the Alien franchise is what makes a film un-respectable.  It's painfully lacking in a plausible plot line backed up by solid science.  And apparently, in space, no one knows how to follow orders or act in a disciplined fashion.  Safety protocols be damned!  Characters defy the flimsy command structure on the ship and swan about doing as they please like rogue cowboys.  You can see disaster coming 7,000 light years away.  So this space crew randomly decides, hey, we don't feel like spending 7 years in stasis to reach their PLANNED destination, so they just veer off to the right and check out this other earth-like planet that's closer and faster to get to.  Do they first send a probe to assess and verify that conditions are truly earth like enough to support human life?  Of course not!  That would make too much sense.  They just make a haphazard bumpy landing and rip their helmets off cuz the air must be ok if there are trees.  (The fact there are only plants and no animals should have been a big sign to proceed with caution, but that word is not in the vocabulary of this script.  Apparently, the lowest level of common sense is not a prerequisite to qualify for crew-status on this space trip. The script is fraught with unclear character motivations, loosely formed relationships that don't give the audience a chance to care about them, catastrophic events that trigger levels of hysteria in the crew utterly un-becoming of what you'd expect from a space exploration team.  It's just laughable all the way through. (And there is little to no referencing back to the prequel film, Prometheus).  What a mess.","3.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","Prometheus 2","SuckaMC","For one, they talk about a sequel to Prometheus in the works, but I can't see how that's necessary since everything has been addressed in Covenant?  (For all I know, the Prometheus sequel may no longer be in the works).I too am one of the few who enjoyed Prometheus, so Covenant, for me, really begins to pick up when they start exploring its links to Prometheus.  In fact, what I found tedious up to that point is how very repetitive Alien movies seems to be:  Here's a ship,  Full of people you never met.  They are on a long journey.  Oh look, they gonna make a unscheduled detour and go to some strange planet.  While there, someone practically shoves their nose at some alien fauna/pod thing to get a better look.  Of course they are infected and something disgusting bursts out of their body.Now, if all that unfolded in a very meta, self-critical sort of way, it could be entertaining.  Unfortunately that's the not case.Its also a never-ending parade of dumb characters making dumb decisions (possible spoilers here):  Go to a strange planet with zero protection other than fatigue uniforms and material caps.  OK.  Risking the lives of 2,000 people to land on the planet.  Sure! And of course, the most predictable moment where ""oh yeah, there was 2 guys that looked exactly alike and we didn't think to make sure we got the right one back"".  Hilarious.Just like zombie TV shows and movies, the actual xenomorphs themselves have become supporting characters and background fodder.  I guess you can only go so far to tell the story of wild, instinctual space animals.It may sound like I dislike this movie, but I really didn't.  Despite its cliches, the story of an immortal mad scientist is pretty fun to me.  If you're following Prometheus to Covenant, you should start to see the secret behind the xenomorph Ripley fights in Alien.  Some may hate the idea of the secret origin, I do find it to be an interesting twist.Overall faster paced than Prometheus and it hits a lot of Alien-type cliches, I'm not really sure how to guess who would like this and who wouldn't.

Covenant is a disaster movie, comprising budget CGI, 2-dimensional characters, nonsensical decision-making and it's everything we've seen before but so much worse.The script tries to develop the ""man as creator"" and parent-child symbolism to the point where it borrows from Frankenstein somewhat heavily and makes David the central character. The trailer has 95% of all alien sequences in the whole film, which sees a cast of idiots echo all the same mistakes from the previous movie. Alien planet? Visit it. Alien atmosphere? Breathe it. Aliens? Get close, hug them. The deaths are telegraphed a mile off and could have been marketed on the Alien planet as a TV show called ""Eating Earth's Dumbest Humans"".The director spends no time giving us anybody to care about, it's just a checklist of scenes he expects us to see, forcing the leads to make a series of terrible decisions to get from one gruesome death to another. Much like the way the Terminator franchise has been gutted by cash-grabbing soulless sequels, I fear this is the end of the Alien story. Gone is the dark, visceral terror that made it a timeless classic - now it's just straight-to-video garbage that I wouldn't watch for free.

At least Scott is exploring new ideas and asking those questions of, HOW and WHY and WHO that the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th films never addressed.  And we do see some new ideas and even old ones take on new forms: a back-burster and even a side-burster rather than traditional chest-bursters.  And two androids?....two identical androids???  Not to mention the most existential question, ""Is Ridley actually going to come full circle with all of this?""

I really liked Prometheus, but think this one is a better movie. Both share a certain pallette and art direction that is just stunning. The movie scares you but also makes you think - which I like in a movie. A bit gratuitously gory for my usual taste but it's expected of an Alien movie. But overall I think it's up there with the first two Alien movies, and think it will age better with time. Frankly, one of the top ten best sci-fi I've ever seen.","5.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","1/5, not really worthy of anything higher ... too confusing, and absurd, but very pretty, as usual","BruceK","I was going to give this review a 2/5, because my feeling is that it was better thanPrometheus, which I did give a 1/5 to.  But then I was thinking about it, and therewere so many infuriating things that did not add up, or make sense in any way, andbecause these crazinesses have become rampant in Ridley Scott's movies, ANDbecause I did not see one 1/5 review for this movie - that is an injustice to moviegoerseverywhere - this is a very pretty, but bad movie.Much of the action and many of the situations were lifted from earlier movies.  Mustof the stupidly of people, the normal walking off alone for some reason to encounterthe monster, or in this movie the monster of the synthetic mass-murderer.I really did like the look of the movie, and I liked that though they had James Francoin it, we did not have to suffer through any scenes of his, except where he dies.  Thatcould almost make me raise it to a 2, but it doesn't balance out of nonsense of thismovie.Why did David, the synthetic, kill the people of this planet.  And where were theretwo alien delivery systems ... the spores and the cocoon things.  And how could thosethings grow to maturity in an hour or two, and by the way have huge big horny spinythings growing on them that presumably is inside the hosts body, and they act likethey just have a case of the blahs????This is another loser or Ridley Scott that seems to make a special effort these daysNOT to make any sense in his movies.

"Alien: Covenant","More of David, a new crew and more Aliens.","James P. McDonald","Alien: Covenant (2017). 20th Century Fox. Rated ""R"". Single disc.  Running Time: 2 hours, 02 mins.Directed and produced by Ridley Scott. Story by Jack Paglen and Michael Green. Screenplay by John Logan and Dante Harper.8th movie in the film series.Returning: Michael Fassbender, Guy Pearce, Noomi Rapace.The movie begins with Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) of the Wayland-Yutani Corporation in his living room speaking with his new synthetic android creation. The room contains a wide-screen wall, a piano and a Michelangelo's Statue of David. The android accepts the name of ""David"" (Michael Fassbender).  Now in December 2104, eleven years after the Prometheus crew perished, Walter One (Michael Fassbender) awakes some of the crew in their hibernation sleep pod aboard the Covenant spaceship. They are 3 years into their 10-year journey to a remote planet, Origae-6, to begin a new life and civilization. Some of the crew members are husband and wife or partner.  Daniels (Katherine Waterston) is married to her husband, Captain Jacob Branson (James Franco).  Tennessee Faris (Danny McBride), the chief pilot, is married to his wife, Maggie (Amy Seimetz).  Ricks (Jussie Smollett), the navigator, is married to his wife, Upworth (Callie Hernandez), communication officer with paramedic training.  Lope (Demian Bichir), head of security unit, is the gay husband to Sergeant Hallett (Nathaniel Dean).  Chris Oram (Billy Crudup), First Mate of Covenant turned Captain, is married to his wife, Karine (Carmen Ejogo).  Cole (Uli Latukefu), Ledward (Benjamin Rigby), Ankor (Alexander England) and Sarah Rosenthal (Tess Haubrich) are members of the security unit.  Walter opens a tool shelf and selects a preserved embryo out of many stored. The sails on this craft have been deployed successfully. Then something goes horribly wrong. Walter puts the embryo inside a biohazard container and leaves to see what is wrong. A neutrino burst hits the craft and undoes one of the sails.  The pod with Captain Jacob Branson malfunctions and he is burned inside and dies. His wife, Daniels is devastated. Her husband wanted to build a cabin by the lake at the new colony.  They have lost 47 crews members so far. To make matters worse, they receive some static from a far radio transmission. Acting Captain, Oram makes a decision to detour or scrap the original mission and visit this planet where the transmission is coming from. This is the Earth-like planet, Theshold, where Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) from the space craft, Prometheus, is stranded at.  The expedition team descends to the surface which appears to be even better for colonization. Waterfalls, lakes, forests and growing wheat.  During the search, Ledward and Hallett separately come across a cluster of bacterial spores in different places. Ledward breaks a cluster with his foot aside a tree and black spores drift in the air and enter his ear. Inside the found, crashed Prometheus space craft, Hallett breaks a cluster and the spores enter into his nostrils.  Ledward and Hallett become very ill and they must all quickly get back to the Lander One.  Wait until you see what happens next!Also in the cast: Andrew Crawford, Javier Botet, Gordon D. Kleut. Lorelei King is the voice of computer, ""Mother"". I always welcome a new ALIEN movie, but I didn't really care for this one. Too much of Michael Fassbender in a dual-role and not enough action aboard the Covenant spaceship with the crew. The ending is predictable.

"Alien: Covenant","It was a terrible letdown compared to the original Alien movies","Aaron","It's basically Prometheus 2.  It was a terrible letdown compared to the original Alien movies.  The plot is terrible, the acting is...meh, and the alien has a mediocre showing.  It's definitely not the intelligent, thinking and plotting Alien from the original movies that hunted its prey.  It's more like a programmed killing robot.  And speaking of robots, that appears to be the whole focus of the story.  It's a story of two robots who share a homoerotic flue solo, followed by a kiss, followed by betrayal and the same tired plot point where an android turns evil and helps the alien.  In between that, a bunch of humans who don't advance the story line, don't advance the story line while being slaughtered by the alien.  I *really* wish I could get my money back.

"Alien: Covenant","The Alien Franchise Moves On From Prometheus, Ripley Has A Worthy Heir & AI/Androids Get Just A Little More Sinister","Richard A Ohge","I loved it - some liked it - a few, evidently not really followers of the franchise, panned it.Some critics faulted the acting, others derided Ridley Scott, but I thought the directing, as well as the players were fine, just unfamiliar, and with not enough back story to flesh them or easily connect them to previous installments, aside from Daniels and Walter/David.From the first movie on the AI/Androids were all pretty much sinister, even the one in Aliens II turned out to be a ""good guy"". This one was the nastiest piece of work to date.We can but hope Daniels will some how make it to the next installment - which will make it fun to watch, as her character had the resilience, instincts, courage and brass of Ripley in I, II, and III. Since she obviously knew they had been duped by the robo-dick, David, we can expect something pretty ass-kicking for her to survive coming out of hyper-sleep. With that and whatever it might take to at least stymie David's nihilistic plans for his own engineered ""Uber Mensch""...WHERE have we heard THAT concept?Perhaps he should name his first ultimate hybrid Nietzsche?The tech was good, and there was an understated ""editorial"" element suggesting the dangers of genetic modification, particularly at the hands of the AI enhanced android, David - That he was fond of Hitler's favorite composer just added to the calm smiling evil - and creates a plot device for a whole other series.We can but hope our own AI and android tech never get put in charge of or infiltrate the design and execution of CRISPR tech, as the outcome might not be so good for the universe.Overall a good movie, that perhaps was like a Master Chef contestant's dish - well done, but in need of a little more seasoning and cooking.We, who have been along for the ride in the Alien franchise to date will happily add this one in, and wait expectantly for where it goes from here...be sure to check your eggs carefully before making that omelet - it's no fun to find yourself becoming the breakfast entree.","5.0 "
"Alien: Covenant","Meaningless,Colossal Disappointment","Zalmorion the Fantastic","Absolutely, this film is an amazing visual thrill ride.  Dark and spooky.  Perfectly integrated special effects.  But the story ... is there a story?  What does this have to do with Prometheus?  Nothing.  How many questions are answered?  None.  How far does this movie push the narrative forward?  It goes backward.  Where are the Engineers?  Who knows?(SPOILER)  Basically, a robot goes crazy and creates Aliens.  This is a fine premise for another movie.  It has nothing to do with Prometheus.  Shaw set out for answers.  Instead, a crazy robot kills her.  The End.  You have to do better than that!The acting was perfect.  The sets were perfect.  The soundtrack felt perfect.  The new aliens were perfect--standing upright, they freaked me out! But this is the weakest, laziest attempt at an Alien/Prometheus sequel you will ever see.  The writing was phoned in.

"Alien: Covenant","Being a Human No Longer Sounds So Appealing","Trevor's View on Hollywood","A human eye fills the screen.A voice asks, “How do you feel?”An A.I. portrayed by Michael Fassbender (12 Years a Slave, Steve Jobs) obeys his creator’s commands in a pale-white room, looking out onto a gorgeous mountain range. His human “father” monologues about his ambition to discover where we came from; since there must be more out there past our own present knowledge. No music plays, just the cold voices of these two men with no real blood in their veins. Fassbender delivers a robotic performance appropriate to his character’s emotionless state, offering what we expect by now from his two Oscar nominations.Once the familiar opening title slowly dissolves into frame, Ridley Scott has concluded perhaps the most meticulously crafted opening of his long career. But once Alien: Covenant gets the ball rolling, no artistry sustains as he straight-up abandons those crucial points about existentialism.Then we meet a crew transporting 2,000 human embryos to another sector to house future generations (basically Interstellar). Good luck trying to keep track of everyone, as they each have too little likability to give a hoot. Take out the government-funded mission, and their maturity levels would make you believe they were teenagers. Do not even bother asking me to point out the lead protagonist, because I am stumped; my guess goes to Katherine Waterston, (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Inherent Vice) who to be fair is pretty solid in her performance. She may be the closest thing to “Ellen Ripley” we got here, yet she never causes enough action to entertain both men and women. Sorry ladies, no female empowerment to be found here.We now made it to the eighth installment of the Alien franchise; Ridley Scott gladly back on the helm. You’d think after thirty-eight years, he should know by now that the future may see different racial struggles not predominantly ruled by White heroes. Nope! He calls too much attention to the White actors while all other ethnicities fall victim to the alien invasion problem started by government-funded programs.However, Scott also successfully brought the franchise back to its refreshing hard R-rating like in the early days, even if he sometimes abuses his creative freedom. (Some unnecessary sex foreplay in the shower comes to mind) Otherwise, 20th Century Fox fulfills its promise: after a crew member touches a spore, he goes coughing in his own blood.But beyond the intense gore, every “scary” moment mishandles the tiresome scare tactics we are sick of by now: jump scares, throwing us into the killer’s perspective, an annoying girl runs away while tripping over her own two feet, etcetera.Thus, the best moments take place within the planet’s familiar yet evocative greenish mountain views, disguised behind a dense fog. In moments that utilize the atmosphere to tell the story, anyone can sense the contrast between man and alien. Deep inside an abandoned ribcage-shaped ship, Fassbender’s A.I. lives. Although the crew keeps a similar version of this same A.I., correspondingly played by the same Fassbender. As the cybernetic twins bond through a flute lesson, they generate most human moment in Ridley Scott’s desire to alter society.Too bad though, his continued exploration of man’s relationship with technology has no proper footing inside our own reality; these themes seem too stuck in 1979 to strike fear into our hearts. While the added concept of intergalactic recolonization works to its advantage, other recent films, simply put, explored it better, such as Scott’s recent instant-classic, The Martian. It seems nobody behind this talky sequel/prequel to Prometheus/Alien could settle on whether to put together a straight-forward horror flick or a psychological metaphor on Trump’s immigration ban, so it instead varies scene-by-scene.So why care about humanity’s near-extinction? Sounds like way more fun to be a Xenomorph!","2.0 "

They then discover that Staneous Leeviticus is from the future also from a previous Dolorean and wanted to design the fate of humanity as he saw fit.Extra star was added for Michael Fassbender and a boob scene.","2.0 "

"Alien: Covenant","What the hell happened??????????","meg","I really can't believe this movie is part of the alien saga. This movie was horrible. I love the alien movies the first the second and the third the forth was ok but definitely better than this. And I realized what was missing. Where was Ripley? Now I know she died in the third alien movie but they made it work in the fourth movie. How do you have an alien movie without Ripley. You can't just throw people together throw an alien monster in the mix and say it's part of the alien saga. Now I grew up watching the alien movies and this was a sad pathetic adaptation. I expected so much more from Ridly Scott. First of all this movie was so predictable. The first alien movie was old and it didn't have the technology that we have now and it was still a superior film. This was so stupid these are supposed to be highly trainded people training for a new world. But let's just forget all that a go somewhere else where we have no guarantees about even the atmosphere and land why not? ( No wonder they died) this was such a disappointment and sorry I waisted 5 dollars. Do yourself a favor don't waist your money or just go watch 1-3. And if your not sure watch the 4th one. (as bad as that was) You never think it could get worse. Then this one came out and you realize it did get worse","1.0 "

Darned good review if I might say so myself! I just had to post it:""Capitan Underpants is everything you could want in a movie: laughter, suspense, and hilariously wacky comedy.  There’s a bit of potty humor, so people that don’t want their kids watching that sort of stuff should maybe reconsider. There are no really scary parts except where Professor Pee Poopy Pants Diarrhea Stain Esquire, wants to get rid of laughter. I have 2 kids ages 6 and 9, and they both loved it. In fact, the next day they were begging me for it again. Kids will love this show. Go Captain Underpants!!!!""Also, another word from me... We often have a hard time finding movies that are appropriate and enjoyable for the whole crew.  This one has really fit the bill.  And yes, lots of potty talk but it hasn't cause any problems for us even though they've watched it so many times :)","5.0 "

This movie plays mostly off the nostalgia that comes with that. It's completely random, the animation is just like the books, and they bring up characters, references and flip-o-rama to scene. I'm glad they didn't do an exact plot, but rather mixed various characters and enemies from different books. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of Mr. Krupp. I didn't care too much for the voice actor. I think everyone imagined him more gruff sounding since he was supposed to be so terrifying to kids, and was always cranky. I think anyone who didn't read the books growing up could still enjoy this, but not as much. Like I said. Is very random. But for everyone who read the books? A good adaption.","4.0 "

"Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie","It's a good film, but if you are a fan of the comics.... you may not fully like this film.","Landon","Yes.... the movie is called ""Captain Underpants"", but its not all about Captain Underpants. (SOME SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW) It's more about the kids who created him. The kids end up being the hero's in this film, and that means that captain underpants is actually just a side character. The Principal is hypnotized into believing he is captain underpants, and he later really does become captain underpants. But, if you are expecting a movie about the awesome adventures of captain underpants, you may not like this film too much. Now, if you see this movie as a animated film in general, its not that bad of a movie. I enjoyed it, but I can see some fans not so much. And that's understandable. Overall, it wasn't bad.","4.0 "

Still, even with the obvious potty humor, it's pretty evenly paced and presents the message that we need to just chill out and enjoy a stupid joke once in a while. If you follow the book series, the story line in this movie is a mash-up of a couple of books, but it doesn't seem jumbled. It wasn't horrible to sit through as an adult - it has enough intelligence to not make you want to gouge your eyes out, and even a few actually funny moments. The kids laughed their butts off in the theater and begged for the movie as soon as it came out on DVD, so I'd say the movie achieved its goal.","4.0 "

I would be inclined to like the movie a bit more if it wasn't so freaking long and drawn out. So terribly drawn out. Like they could've accomplished in an hour easily but took nearly 2 hours? Geez. The books are super short so why isn't the movie? I have a short attention span and I know kids have an even shorter one. How they can commit to a movie this long is beyond me. I fell asleep. There, I said it. I spent money to basically fall asleep inside a movie theater for about an hour. And you know what? I didn't miss much. I really didn't. Which annoys the crap out of me because a movie shouldn't be like that. But this one is. Yes, I am a grown-ass man reviewing a children's movie but come on. There are better, way better, kid's movies out there than this one. Like this is the kind of movie that is an absolute last resort to play when there is nothing, and I do mean nothing (in the age of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, etc., this should prove to be impossible) to watch, this is your movie.

"Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie","Sure to amuse you while enjoying your summer vacation","Ranny Levy","Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie is hilarious! I really enjoyed this film. It is an animated comedy with plenty of action based on a series of books by author Dav Pilkey. It gives us a chance to experience the genius of two fourth grade smart pranksters, George Beard (Kevin Hart) and Harold Hutchins (Thomas Middleditch) as they bring to life their comic book character Captain Underpants, a silly, dimwitted superhero wearing his underwear and a cape. Captain Underpants and his side-kicks George and Harold are fighting against the evil Professor Poopy-Pants (Nick Kroll) who wants to rid the world of happiness.The animation and visual images of the film are exciting and colorful.  Since the book series is known for its action sequences and gross, potty humor, expect plenty of rude language and cartoonish violence. The music makes you sing along and tap your feet. There is a message about friendship. For kids, it's a reminder that friendship does not mean you must be in the same class to remain friends.My favorite scene is when George and Harold discover that they can hypnotize the mean-hearted school principal Mr. Krugg (Ed Helms) and turn him into their comic book super hero, Captain Underpants. They realize a snap of the finger gives them Captain Underpants and water changes him back to Principal Krugg. To hide his identity, the duo is challenged with keeping him as Principal Krugg when needed and bringing out Captain Underpants to fight bad guys.I recommend this for ages 7 to 18 as well as some adults. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Juanita L. KIDS FIRST! juror. For more film reviews by kids and adults, go to kidsfirst dot org.","5.0 "

I love everything about them, so, as you'd expect, when I heard this movie was coming out I went absolutely nuts! The movie was just as amazing as I hoped it would be!! George and Harold were just as lovable as in the books and my favorite character, Harold, had a the perfect voice actor and he stayed true to his real personallity....in fact all of all the main cast ( Especially Captain Underpants ) had the perfect voice actors for their parts! I remember when Captain Underpants first appeared in the movie and belted out his ""Tra La Laa!"" I screamed in pure joy and excitement.Everything about the movie was incredible.

If you didn’t read the books it’s still a solid movie but you might not “get it”Now onto the problem of this specific dvd case which is so disappointing since we paid same price as we would have at Target but we had a GC to use. This might make you change your mind where to purchase.The dvd case was open on both sides - not like a regular dvd case you get in the store. Why would you choose to wrap it in strong cellophane with only a piece of paper between the disc and plastic wrap? My kids scratched the copy dvd and thankfully not the blue ray. How much money did the seller save by going with such a cheap case? Will only get new release dvd from Target going forward.","4.0 "

"Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie","Tra-La-Laaa!","James N Simpson","Captain Underpants is a pretty fun animated kids movie, which is entertaining for adult viewers as well.  There's plenty of big cultural references for adults from our own childhood era throughout such as Star Wars, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, some of the women characters wear glasses you used to see in Far Side cartoons, even ""Weird Al"" sings the theme song. The soundtrack is pretty good, and there's a sock puppet scene in this that is just awesome. The movie's story is well done, and important for child readers is loyal to the storylines of a few of the books in the series of the same name by Dav Pilkey.Basically the plot of this is two best friend kids constantly play pranks at school because they think the staff, especially the principal have made school boring. One of them loves to write and one loves to draw so they have created many comic book series, many of which have been confiscated by the principal.  However knowing they will do something at the school talent contest night, the principal and school suck up now have proof to take disciplinary action. He's going to put these boys in separate classes. For them of course this is devastating news, and believe this will be an end to their friendship (even though they live next door to each other).  So snapping and throwing a tantrum one of them jumps on the principal's desk and pulls out a hypnotism ring he got from a breakfast cereal box.  To the boy's surprise the ring works, they can make their principal become whatever they want starting with a chicken. But it is their invention of a superhero so cool he doesn't just wear his underwear on the outside of his pants, he doesn't even wear pants at all, that they decide to turn their principal into.  However unbeknownst to them, an angry genius inventor has been ridiculed by his colleagues and given no respect for his brilliant inventions due to his name which they all laugh at.  He has a plan to rid the world of laughter, and what better way to implement his plans then to take up a job as a school teacher.","5.0 "
"Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie","TRA-LA-LAA!  Great Fun!","Joseph Baneth Allen","Just finished watching ""Captain Underpants - The First Epic Movie"" released by 20th Century Fox.TRA-LA-LAA!Okay, I couldn't resist....Based on the popular children's novels that combine prose and illustrations, ""Captain Underpants - The First Epic Movie"" is, as you guessed it CU fans,  the origin story of how fourth grade best friends and pranksters George and Harold turn their principal into the comic book hero that they created by hypnotizing him in order to avoid the consequences of their latest prank.Like all good plans, their ultimate prank goes awry when Captain Underpants hires Professor Poopypants to be the new science teacher - and who just happens to be a disgraced evil genius who wants to rid the world of laughter.Yes, there is mild underwear and equally mild bathroom jokes; but Captain Underpants has a good natured humor about it and is just plain old fashioned fun.Plus George and Harold grow in this movie and have to make tough choices once they learn that pranks can cause more harm then good.I hope there is a sequel in the works!Highly Recommended!Five Stars!","5.0 "

It must have been because The Boss Baby was nominated for best animated feature.Don't let the title of this film fool you because it is one of the smartest and funniest animated films to be released in 2017. With a fantastic cast including Kevin Hart, Thomas Middleditch, Ed Helms and Nick Kroll we go into the inner workings of childhood friendship and of course the power of imagination. This film has such a unique style with some very smart comedy and would you believe it a heart warming story that is actually a bit juvenile! As someone who never read the books seeing the trailers got me so interested in this movie and I have to say it was one of the most fun times I had in theaters.

Brought the book series to life :)","Amazon Customer","I never read the books but my 9 year old says the animated movie brought the characters to life.I watched it with the kids and had some laugh out loud moments myself.The principal does get angry and there are some teachable moments especially about honesty and pranking.  Probably not good for the younger kids.","4.0 "
"Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie","One redeeming quality. In a bad movie. Pick a different one.","Andrew Lyke","It seems to me the heart of this movie has to do with two great friends who are forced to sit through unnecessary boredom by their grade school teachers, who are not at all interested in the level of interest and comprehension by their own students. These two have become pranksters to re-awaken interest for their classmates. On that score, the description sounds fairly solid, useful and even heartwarming. Except that it seems the pranks are forever front-and-center. Perhaps by this much of a description one's mind goes to Dangerous Minds (Michelle Pfeiffer), Freedom Writers (Hilary Swank) and Summer School (Mark Harmon). These teachers had unruly children in their classroom, and they actually cared about the future of the kids being lost to a heartless system, whereas in Captain Underpants, the unruly pair had become unruly to get the attention of teachers and students, to make them aware education is not possible in this situation.It occurs to me that if you have read this far, either you are already bored or you understand where they are coming from. Perhaps mis-spelling on purpose would liven things up. Perhaps some interjections would bring some life into it. I get the reason for the pranks. It's a good point; but it covers the entire movie. And they do not seem ever to wake up.","1.0 "

"Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie","More suited for younger audiences or those who are fans of the books","JWINK","I am a fan of animated movies, but this particular one didn’t appeal to me very much.  I think mainly it is because it is for younger audiences in the 6 to 12-year age range.  It is filled with a lot of silly potty humor and fart jokes that would make young kids giggle.  The story is a bit all over the place with its mix of the main characters narrating the movie, the comic book drawing stories and the various things in between.  As an adult, I just thought the story was a bit too silly and juvenile.  The animation was good but to me, there are better animated films that appeal better to both adults and kids.  If you or the kids are a fan of the books, then you may enjoy this film more than me.2 stars","2.0 "

I do feel that most of the bathroom humor was a bit too much and it was one after another. I mean look it was nice to have that nostalgia feeling but sadly it didn't make me laugh like I had hope.

I don't use iTunes for movies so I returned it.  Universal Pictures wants nothing to do with this issue and has put it on STX Entertainment.

"A Bad Moms Christmas","Not as funny as the original; digital copy is iTunes only","Terry R. Nye","My wife and I enjoyed the original Bad Moms movie, and we also enjoy quirky Christmas movies, so we thought we would really enjoy A Bad Moms Christmas.  The movie is largely laugh out loud funny, but it drags toward the end and gets almost depressing at one point.  Christine Baranski is funny but she does not resemble Mila Kunis at all and is miscast as Mila's mother.  All the other casting is good, and it appears most everyone from the original movie returned for the sequel.  The humor is adults only, as expected, but there is nothing funny or appropriate about a young child using extreme profanity which occurred several times in this film.  That aside, the movie was fun, the scenes with the male stripper are hilarious, and I'm sure it's one we will watch again at Christmas time.  As others have said, this sequel is not as funny or good as the original Bad Moms movie.The big disappointment about this Blu-Ray version of the movie is the digital copy code only works for iTunes.  All other movies we own with digital copy use either Vudu or Movies Anywhere, so this was a huge disappointment.  Unless you plan to watch digital movies on an Apple product you will not be happy with the digital copy.","3.0 "
"A Bad Moms Christmas","Pure Torture","Jill Sim","The first installment was a woman-centric 'Hangover,' that was pleasantly stupid with some genuinely funny moments. The second flick is a pointless, unimaginative, uninteresting, offensively unfunny, Christmas-themed iteration of the woman-centric 'Hangover,' and I couldn't bear to finish it. If you want old and unoriginal tropes of exotic animals wandering around houses after a 'wild evening,' terrible relatives descending during the holidays that the dishrag characters can't work up the courage to confront so as to manufacture artificial conflict; if you want drawn out scenes with cliche dialogue and crashingly dull plot lines; if you want a failed gag involving Kenny G playing saxophone; and an endless scene involving scrotum waxing, then this is the movie for you. Good God it's terrible.  One of the worst movies ever made. On the plus side, Mila Kunis has terrific hair.","1.0 "

Christine Baranski steals the show with her obstinate ways and perfection, Sarandon is always Perfect and i was really sad that Christina Applegate only had a quick cameo since she was such a great part of the first one.I love the original three and the chemistry still works although there is less of the three of them together.

"A Bad Moms Christmas","Great Holiday Fun","David Moore","I remember seeing the first film in theaters, and it was wall-to-wall laughter.  Bad Moms was such an entertaining movie, and this Holiday Sequel will not disappoint. If you enjoyed the first film, your going to enjoy this one. The only real problem with this film is the writer and director's fear of straying to far away from the first films storyline formula.  They don't take many chances, and while they attempt to cover it up by turning it into a Holiday movie, you cant help but feel like they just repurposed the first film for the holidays. However, it steals no enjoyment away from you, nor any of the laughter.  Those who claim to have not liked this film, simply didn't because they were afraid it wouldn't measure up, therefore, they choose to dislike the film before it could possibly let them down.  To them I say. ""Boooo!""  Everyone else, ""Enjoy the show! It's gonna make you laugh and feel good.""","4.0 "

"A Bad Moms Christmas","A poor sequel.  Not funny, not entertaining.","M. Oleson","Possible spoilers.  This is a lame sequel to a pretty funny “Bad Moms” from 2016.  Once again directed and written by the “Hangover” boys, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, this second take devolves dramatically just like the “Hangover” series did.The original bad moms are back.  Amy (Mila Kunis) is now divorced, Kiki (Kristen Bell) is still dealing with her 4 kids and non-descript husband and Carla (Kathryn Hahn) has moved up in the world working for a salon where she specializes in waxing the nether regions.  It’s Christmas time and Amy is hoping to have a quiet Christmas with her two kids and her new boyfriend, Jessie (Jay Hernandez) and his little girl.  But it won’t be quiet for long as Amy’s mom Ruth (Christine Baranski) shows up with her money and decides to convert Amy’s home into party central for dozens of guests.  She has a 5 hour “Nutcracker” she wants the family to attend along with hours of competitive caroling.  It’s not only too much for Amy, it’s too much for the audience as well.Not only does mother Ruth show up, so does Kiki’s lonely mother Sandy (Cheryl Hines).  She wants to be closer to her daughter.  So much so she decides to hide in Kiki’s bedroom to make sure she and her husband have a satisfactory sex life.  Eww!  She also decides to buy the house next door.  Too much?  You bet.  I will say this; Hines has a funny scene with Bell when her character goes through a litany of serious illnesses she might have beginning with heart cancer.  I did laugh.Carla’s surprise visitor is her mother Isis (Susan Sarandon), who shows up having hitch-hiked with a trucker.  She hasn’t spoken to her daughter for years and when she does she’s usually asking for money.  Hahn as raunchy Carla is always hilarious even when the writers don’t give her much to work with.  The big haha here has her doing a wax on a well-endowed fireman/male stripper (Justin Hartley).  While the scene was originally pretty funny, it just went too far.  To the point where it wasn’t.The men in the film are nothing more than pets.  Peter Gallagher plays Hank, Amy’s father who does come with Ruth.  He doesn’t say anything until about 60 minute mark which then has you wondering who is this guy anyway.  The actions of the characters in the story are just too far-fetched to be believable.  The 3 ladies who are so busy they can’t keep it together seem to always find time at the last minute to hit the latest sale or nearest bar.None of this would have mattered if we were kept entertained with good jokes and funny scenes.  Alas they were hard to find.  Hopefully this will be the last but I’m not holding my breath.","2.0 "

It will not port to Vudu or MoviesAnywhere, so use is limited on smart TVs or DVD players or some Roku/Fire Stick/GoogleCast. In other words, if you are not wanting to watch on an iPhone or PC/Mac, you are screwed.

"A Bad Moms Christmas","Disappointing","James N Simpson","A Bad Moms Christmas or Bad Moms 2 as it is also known, is nowhere in the league of the original.  The original worked as it was average women, feeling insecure and that they were lesser mothers, from bullying mothers at their kids school and society in general who worked out that there was nothing wrong with their parenting.  With the sequel that storyline is no longer there, Kunis, Bell and Hahn's characters seemingly now content that their mother skills are good, instead their mother characters take up most of the screen time.  Unlike the first movie, there is no doubt in the viewers mind that these three older women are bad mothers/grandmothers.  Christine Baranski pretty much plays the same character she does on the Big Bang Theory, I kept waiting for her to mention her disappointing son Leonard. It also didn't make much sense that upon immediately seeing her daughter's boyfriend, she judges him as the help based on his skin tone, yet her daughter has much darker skin than her and the doormat guy she's brought with her, so obviously he isn't Amy's father and at least at some stage in her life she accepted a darker skin tonned man as worthy of being in her bedroom.  Cheryl Hines plays a mother who likes to watch her daughter and his husband between the sheets, and wants to be a trio in their marriage.  I doubt anyone thinks that's a normal mother, or with Susan Sarandon's character who doesn't even really acknowledge her mentally challenged grandson and just wants to steal from and ""borrow"" large wads of cash from her daughter.It also doesn't have much to offer on the Christmas theme side of things, spending too much time in a beauty salon, trampoline theme park and strip club bar for women,  So doesn't leave it's mark as a classic Christmas movie to watch each year. This is no Christmas Vacation, which it could have been with well written characters and going through the motions of what a lot of people do at Christmas time (with a lot of humorous hurdles along the way).","3.0 "

"A Bad Moms Christmas","2.5 stars... Nowhere near as good as the first ""Bad Moms""","Paul Allaer","""A Bad Moms Christmas"" (2017 release; 104 min.) brings more from the original ""bad moms"". As the movie opens, we once again hear Amy introduce the story. ""I am Amy Mitchell and I just ruined this year's Christmas"" she tells us, amidst what appears to be a war zone in her house (and a camel walking by!). We then go back in time to ""6 Days Before Christmas"", where the story begins as Amy gets ready for Christmas and things start going wrong when her parents, and in particular her domineering mom, show up. In parallel stories, Kiki and Carla also get visited by their moms. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: last year's ""Bad Moms"" was an unexpected success, and I found it to be somewhat of a delightful little move, in particular with Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell playing ""against character"" as the ""moms gone wild"" in the funniest of ways. So when a sequel was announced, I was all in. Once again co-written and co-directed by Scott Moore and Jon Lucas, nothing could go wrong, right? Sadly, I must report that this sequel is nowhere close to the original, and nowhere near as funny. Why? While in and of itself it seemed like a good idea to add the three mothers of the original bad moms to to plot, it actually resulted in this being a movie more about the mothers of the bad moms, than it is about the bad moms themselves. In particular, this is mostly about Amy and her domineering (and thoroughly unlikable) mother, although of course the other two bad moms and their mothers get plenty of screen time too. The weird thing is that, contrary to the original movie, the bad moms are no longer bad at all in any respect, in fact trying like crazy to win their mothers' approval and love and pleasing their respective loved ones as best they can. Yes, there is one scene early in the movie where the moms go crazy during a shopping mall spree, but that's about it. And then there are the male strippers scenes (yes plural), which got a lot of hollering and hooting from the theater crowd (mostly female, of course). There was no such reaction when the young girl (daughter of Amy's boyfriend, maybe 6 or so?) dropped the F bomb, not once, not twice, but multiple time. The bottom line is that Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis and Kathryn Hahn are sadly overshadowed by their mothers, played by Cheryl Hines, Christine Baranski, and Susan Sarandon, respectively.""A Bad Moms Christmas"" opened wide on Wednesday. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended just okay (not even half full in a small theater), quite surprising for a movie's opening weekend. I'd say this does not bode well for the long term success of this movie. Surely this will not generate strong word of mouth. I had high hopes for this movie, but sadly the film makers deviated way too much from the original premise, and this should've been called ""The bad moms' mothers screwed-up Christmas"". I encourage you to check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","3.0 "
"A Bad Moms Christmas","Long and sloppy","pattk77","Another forced Christmas comedy with a lot of stars. I like the subtle humor at times but everything else is cringe-worthy forced. I don't think a little girl repeatedly saying the F word is funny either, it's a cheap way to try and get a laugh.  Lazy screenwriting. Where Christmas Vacation and Meet The Parents took the time to create a real world and a level of depth in certain scenes this one has not of that. It's jokes first then they try to create family turmoil that's faker than a 3 dollar bill. Remember the scene where Clark is looking at family photos in the attic while a Christmas song is on in the background.. this movie has nothing like that in terms of heart.","2.0 "
"A Bad Moms Christmas","“Bad”....Mom’s Christmas — boring, raunchy, not funny, and BAD","JKH","The movie is aptly named as the movie is certainly “bad.”  Very few good plot lines or humor.  There’s maybe 5-10 minutes of actual humor.  The rest is just stupid.  For example, there are scenes where the trashy girl and her mom stand outside a grocery store and steal groceries.  Another scene is the girls roaming around a mall destroying things and stealing.  It’s just idiotic.Maybe if you are mentally impaired or drunk, this movie would seem funnier.  But, in my view, it’s horrible.  This is a shame because many comedies manage to have edgy, funny content and a plot.  They missed the mark here.","1.0 "

"A Bad Moms Christmas","""A Bad Moms Christmas"" is pretty good.","Kris King","""A Bad Moms Christmas"" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: A Bad Moms Christmas follows our three under-appreciated and over-burdened women as they rebel against the challenges and expectations of the Super Bowl for moms: Christmas.The cast led by Mila Kunis (also executive produced) (as Amy), Kristen Bell (as Kiki), Kathryn Hahn (as Carla), Cheryl Hines (as Sandy), Christine Baranski (as Ruth) & Susan Sarandon (as Isis) is pretty good. The directing, story & screenplay by Jon Lucas & Scott Moore is pretty good.The music by Christopher Lennertz is pretty good. The cinematography by Mitchell Amundsen is pretty good. The film editing by James Thomas is pretty good. The production design by Marcia Hinds is pretty good. The set dressings by Sam Carter, Melissa Kay Glaze, Kiersten Sonja Good, Joel Martin, Chuck McCourt, Mazzy Solana & Eitan Sonnenberg is pretty good. The sound editing by Kami Asgar, Trevor Metz, Andrew Neil, Erin Oakley & Paul Pirola and sound mixing by Patrick Christensen, Judah Getz, Bob Lacivita, Chris Navarro, Matthew Nicolay, Greg Orloff & Julian Slater is pretty good. The casting by Cathy Sandrich Gelfond & Amanda Mackey is pretty good. The visual effects coordinated by Fabienne DeMars & supervised by Chris LeDoux is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Steven Ritzi is pretty good.This is a pretty good sequel that is decently made and decently done. It isn't as good as the first one, but it is still good, nonetheless. Mila Kunis (as Amy), Kristen Bell (as Kiki) & Kathryn Hahn (as Carla) are solid as usual, and their supporting cast led by Cheryl Hines (as Sandy), Christine Baranski (as Ruth) & Susan Sarandon (as Isis) is just as solid and good as they are. Jon Lucas & Scott Moore has done another solid job, again. This is one of the better comedies of the year and of the holiday season, as well.","4.0 "

But my review is going to focus on the fact that the makers of this movie had a very young child say 'Oh my f-ing god' 3 times in the first part of the movie. I'm not a parent, but this offends me in so many ways. This is a low blow from Hollywood (what they are known for). The mother of ARIANA GREENBLATT should be ashamed of herself for allowing the scum of Hollywood to exploit her child's innocence for monetary gain! My husband and I were appalled and shocked. Just when I think Hollywood couldn't sink lower, they have managed to blow my mind again with how out of touch with America they truly are. Is this the best movie you can make Mila? Is this what you want to be known for? I don't know about any other Chirstians out there, oh, I'm sorry Joy Behar, I meant mentally unstable people, but the use of the phrase 'oh my god' over and over on tv and in the movies is unnecessary and just an outright disrespect and disregard for all Christians everywhere. So no matter how many of you think that that us religious nuts don't matter, I can explain to all of Hollywood why movie sales and viewership is down.....your movies are offensive and terrible.

"A Bad Moms Christmas","Twice the Mothers, Half the Laughs","Carl Schultz","Last year’s picture “Bad Moms,” about three overworked, exhausted, and stressed-out suburban mothers who decide to temporarily abandon their domestic responsibilities for a jolt of fun and self-indulgence, boasted a box office gross of nearly $184 million on an investment of just $20 million.  With that sort of financial return, an eventual sequel was inevitable.But hardly anyone besides the producers expected the followup to arrive so quickly—principal photography on “A Bad Moms Christmas” began in May 2017, less than a year after the release of the original picture, and was completed in time for the film to be deposited into a whopping 3615 theaters on November 01.The release of “A Bad Moms Christmas” into theaters was actually moved back two days from its original November 03 debut date so the picture wouldn’t drown at the box office in the wake of “Thor:  Ragnarok,” which even prior to release was expected to become a financial juggernaut.“A Bad Moms Christmas” reunites the three rebellious suburban mothers from the first picture—Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn—and follows their characters as they interact over the Christmas holiday with their own visiting mothers, played by Christine Baranski, Cheryl Himes, and Susan Sarandon.The solitary distinction which separates “A Bad Moms Christmas” from a typical frat boy comedy or Seth Rogan opus such as “Neighbors” is that the catalysts of the humor are female.  Otherwise, the quality is about the same—broad and raunchy.  Considering the haste of the production, the entire enterprise feels suspiciously like exploitation, with a certain sense of distain for the intended audience.And critically, the reception has been mixed—the Rotten Tomatoes website based on 71 reviews awards “A Bad Moms Christmas” with an approval rating of 31%, with an average rating of 4.4 out of 10.  The critical consensus indicates, “Twice the moms but roughly half the laughs.”Mother always told us--""Haste makes waste.""  When will we ever learn?","2.0 "

Certainly I believe in the message behind A Dog's Purpose. The movie is not an exact replica of the book, and it's not possible to be. The book is far more in-depth, but at more than 300 pages, it's going to be. The movie is another telling of a great story, and it's a charming, sometimes heartbreaking, always heart-tugging, nostalgic romp of a great time.

"A Dog's Purpose","Delicious!","Dirk Turgid","My brilliant and beautiful wife and I have owned/been owned by ten dogs in twenty-seven years, all with one thing in common; under ""breed"" on the forms, we put ""rescue"".Without a doubt, our various muttlings have brought more dimension and meaning into our lives, almost like discovering a new colour in the spectrum. This movie has the same energizing flow to it; it reminds of the absolute purity of a dog's love, serving (I believe) as an object lesson to me how how I should love others.Attached is a snap of our dog Mattie, who was severely abused, beaten, and neglected for five years. She has healed enough to trust me as her partner in the International Freestyle Synchronized Snoring Olympiad (Open Mammals Division).Unfortunately, we only accomplished the Silver Medal, losing out to a Hottentot and a squid. I immediately filed a protest, of course, that a squid is *NOT*, legally, per se, visually, obviously, pro rata, distinctly, taxonomically, a mammal, but before genetic testing could be done to answer my claim, the Japanese judge had the squid over for lunch. His ruling: ""Delicious!""","5.0 "
"A Dog's Purpose","Wow! Heartfelt tearjerker!","Elizabeth","I LOVED THIS MOVIE! It resonated with me. I have several dogs I love very much and have had several over my life as my parents have always been long time animal lovers and dog lovers. Pets have played big roles in my life and this gives them a perspective that we play a huge role in their lives too. It's not a one sided deal. They are one aspect of our big world but we are a HUGE aspect of theirs or almost the only aspect of theirs. It gives us the chance to see how they see and to appreciate them for that. I love that about this movie.I'd recommend bringing lots of tissues as my friend and I cried lots and lots. Might not be a fab family movie but I wouldn't say it's bad either because it does teach a respect for animals that they aren't just play things that you can get bored of and throw away, they are responsibility. Maybe not the best for super young audiences because of all the sad parts.I wouldn't listen to rotten tomatoes on this one at all. It's way off. It's totally worth the buy and I wish I had seen it in theaters. You might find a new understanding when you look at your dog after watching this movie! It's 100% worth watching! 10/10 👌👏💯","5.0 "
"A Dog's Purpose","A wonderful movie  about dogs and how much they bring to our lives","P. Hayes","This movie is so wonderful. At first I was hesitant to watch it since I am an animal lover and I was afraid it would be too sad  too watch. Finally after reading reviews I gave in and was so touched by the story line. I did shed plenty of tears but I also laughed a lot and enjoyed the antics of Bailey. It is a wonderful story and how great it would/will be if it is  true and maybe  my beloved dog Sheba is not across the Rainbow Bridge  but still here on earth with a different identity and  our paths will cross...wouldn't it be wonderful.I first rented the movie from Amazon and I loved it so much I ordered my own copy so I could watch it often.","5.0 "
"A Dog's Purpose","Its A Dog Life.","skyhog45","At first, I thought this would be a little too childish and simple for a man my age, BUT I really enjoyed the movie. I use to have a Golden Retriever, best dog I ever owned. It kind of gave me a little hope that my old dog went on to a happy place. She passed at 14 with cancer.I no longer own a dog or any pet. I live in the city with very little room for a dog. Recently a stray Chocolate Lab appeared on my porch, it was a super sweet dog, but whoever had owned him certainly did not take care of him. His coat was in terrible shape, I finally gave in and called the Animal Control service, the lady who picked him up said they would get him in shape and find him a good home, he was a sweet dog and if I had the room I would have kept him.","5.0 "
"A Dog's Purpose","Grew up on movies like this","Craig Clotfelter","This was an incredibly good movie. It reminded me of some of my favorite movies as a kid. They don't make very many good, family movies that are appropriate for kids that are reflective these days. This is one of those movies. Probably not appropriate for really little kids because it touches on some tough themes. Particularly about how we treat dogs. Even though it is a heartwarming story, it may be too much if you child is really sensitive. I would strongly encourage one to give it a go.","5.0 "
"A Dog's Purpose","Something to ponder","M. C. Will","Oh my goodness!  I'd never heard of this movie and the book until Amazon told me I might like it.  After reading reviews I decided I'd better not miss out and it was a wonderful story.  I watched it with my son who is as crazy about animals as I am and he also had to use a few tissues to wipe away tears.  The happy and funny parts greatly outweigh the sad ones.  It makes us think there can be something to this thing of coming back in another time and form.  Tigger, if you are out there somewhere, I don't have that many years left myself so you'd better make tracks and find me soon.","5.0 "
"A Dog's Purpose","Good Movie, no spoliers plan on looking at your dog differently after","H J Duff","No (minimal) spoilers: Movie follows a dog on as he travels from one doggie lifetime to another(^not really a spoiler since the movie relays this info to you in the first 5 minutes)This movie handles that pretext nicely, as the dog lives and experiences many different doggie experiences, people and other animals.I enjoyed the telling of this story, many moments felt very genuine and true. There is some sadness, in this movie,but, given how this type of movie compels you to open your heartthe movie stays hopeful most of the time and doesn't convey nearly as much sadness as there could have been.I saw some have said not recommended for young children, there was a bit of violence, but not so much that it would violate the PG rating for me.My rule of thumb is,when in doubt, I'll watch the movie to completion without any kids first.I felt safe watching this movie with my 13 year old the first time through, and did not regret it.Our family had been graced with many wonderful dogs including 13 years with an amazing Boxer Mix that is missed every single day so yea, we all cried during the movie.All in all the movie was very light hearted,funny, clever and worth a watch.My version did come with an Ultraviolet Digital Copy, activated without issue on my Vudu account, and showed up on my linked Amazon Video account as well afterwards.","5.0 "
"A Dog's Purpose","Very good movie, I'm satisfied with my purchase and I watch it every now and then when I need a good cry!","Desirae Landon","This movie is fantastic, it is probably not the best movie for children or younger audiences because it shows the truth behind owning a dog; they grow old, they die. This movie brings a bittersweet to anyone who has ever owned a dog twist to it, the dog is reincarnated into multiple lives where they search to find their purpose for existing and what the point of existence is. I can honestly say as someone who has loved and lost dogs, this movie tugged really hard on my heartstrings and I honestly cried multiple times watching it. It made me think about all of the times dogs from across the street, desperately tugging on their leashes to see me might have been my beloved dogs who were no longer with me and had passed on to the rainbow bridge. There was quite a bit of controversy with this film because of the clips that PETA had spliced together showing the German Shepherd hesitating to go into the water (he was uneasy because they switched the side of the pool he was jumping in, he wasn't drowning, the ""running"" water was the result of high powered fans and there were dive teams on standby watching over him). Regardless, I purchased this movie and I am very happy with it, my whole family (all adults) gathered around the television and watched this, and we all can agree that we loved it! I would like to see the next book made into a movie, the only issue I had was that the ending felt a little rushed.","5.0 "
"A Dog's Purpose","Disappointed","kellyd7011","I loved the book, and should really know better, but was not thrilled with the movie.  All the nuance was lost and came across as trite and formulaic.  It's a good movie for that day that you're sick, laying on the couch and need comfort food and comfort movies.  It's family friendly and your 10 y.o. will enjoy it.

The words sound like something dogs would say!  Like the fact that they think about food, a lot!!!  The movie did not make me cry, maybe because I had already read the book.  The cinematography was so beautiful, such sweeping views of scenery.  The places that were bad for dogs were filmed in a way that made them look a lot darker.

It is rated PG but it is intense for kids, my 2 kids had to leave at certain point as it was upsetting and one of them is a teenager.  We love our dogs.  It has a happy ending but the journey their was difficult.  This is 90% drama, not a comedy or an adventure story.  You can also remind your kids that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.Spoiler Alert that prepares the rough point:The police dog part is very intense, good but sad, if you want to take your kids out of the room.","4.0 "
"A Dog's Purpose","Powerful and Moving","Douggee","This is one of the most powerful and moving movies I have ever seen.  I've long been involved with dog rescues and anti-anxiety abuse.  I've adopted 5 dogs in total and 2 are still with me.  Of those 5, 2 were considered unadoptable because of prior abuse.  One took me over two years to turn into a dog again other than being a fearful animal afraid of everything including my rescued cats.  This movie brought back many of those memories and I cried and cried once I figured it out.  The ending was happy enough to make me cry some more.I've just ordered this for my sister but warned her it's a movie that will bring her to tears.  She used to raise huskies so she has a powerful love for dogs too.","5.0 "
"A Dog's Purpose","The book was better","Stonewall63","Having finished the book, I promptly went out to buy the DVD. Maybe that was the problem. The book was more expansive and its finality more complete. The personality of each dog was much more developed and his/her reasoning and thought processes more enjoyable to the reader. The movie seemed superficial, predictable, and manipulative. There was a sadness to the book that was not present in the movie. Also, the dramatic interplay between Ethan and Bailey at the end of the movie seemed much more understated and matter of fact than that described in the book. In and of itself, the movie is entertaining enough, but it falls far short of what the author had given us. I think the movie tried to accomplish more than was possible  during the time given too it, and it left me disappointed.","3.0 "
"A Dog's Purpose","Better than the critics would have you believe.","Doug Mc","I think this movie caught a bad rap.  It does not have the strongest of story lines but the concept is interesting enough to carry one through.  My problem is that I can watch a film where hundreds of people die including the main character & never feel a thing because I can mentally separate reality from the fantasy which I am watching; however, kill one dog & I am a mess.  That is what this is about dog reincarnation and the first puppy dies within minutes so be prepared.  If you are a dog person, it is definitely worth a watch but I would skip the purchase & go for the rental.","4.0 "

Several of my friends who had seen the movie told me that they were disappointed in the movie because it was not as good as the book.  I loved the movie and I couldn’t imagine that the book would be that much better, so I read the book to see why my friends were a little disappointed in the movie.  I now agree that the book was much better than the movie.  However, I was not disappointed in the movie because I couldn’t compare it with the book.  On the other hand, watching the movie did not make reading the book any less enjoyable.  Suffice it to say, I enjoyed both versions of this dog’s story.  The book just let me get into the dog’s mind better.","4.0 "

He would play in the room by himself for hours when he was a puppy where Moka's ashes were until I had the room saged!I know now that what I thought was my beautiful Moka was also my Bodie, even though Moka was an American Female Chocolate Lab and Bodie was a Male English Lab, exact opposites.

"A Dog's Purpose","This movie is the best I have ever seen! WARNING: SPOILER ALERT!","Suwen Cheng","Even though there are multiple choices for a movie, especially one that is a sensation to everyone, no other movie displays this better than the movie A Dog’s Purpose.As we journey through the eyes of Bailey the dog, the main character, we learn about the journey and multiple lives he takes on to answer his one question, “what is my purpose to life?” Through his journey as a family dog, police dog, and stray dog, the main life he remembers is when he meets a young boy named Ethan who took care of him and gave him the name Bailey. After a horrific accident, Ethan’s life is turned upside down which affected Bailey towards the end of his life. From the other lives he took on, he learns lessons from them and he learned the meaning to his life, “Have fun, obviously. Whenever possible, find someone to save, and save them. Lick the ones you love. Don't get all sad-faced about what happened and scrunchy-faced about what could. Just be here now.”This movie was just really appealing to all of my senses. It had many emotional folds, drama, and humorous scenes where it created irony like the story “The Mixer”. Even with these factors, the movie is so much more. It explains the hardships and bright parts of life. In some scenes, you will find yourself crying from the emotion and drama the story displays.Overall, this movie is in an entire new category for entertainment. It fits in with comedy, maybe romance, family, and drama. I guarantee that when you watch this movie, the time and money you spent on watching this movie is worth it and you will be enjoying life as it is.","5.0 "

"A Dog's Purpose","A Beautiful, Heartwarming Story for All Dog Lovers!","Kristin B.","When I heard about the movie A Dog's Purpose arriving in theaters, I was very interested because my family owned a couple dogs when I was growing up. I'm someone who always has to read the book before seeing the movie so I read both A Dog's Purpose: A Novel for Humans and A Dog's Journey: A Novel (A Dog's Purpose) prior to watching the movie. I LOVED the books so much I finished them both within a few days and I laughed, cried, and smiled so much that I couldn't wait to see the movie!A Dog's Purpose is the story of a dog who is reborn several times as different breeds of dogs in different living situations and with, mostly, different owners. Each time he is reborn, he recalls events from his past lives and builds on his experiences so by the end of the story, he realizes how much he has learned and he's discovered what his purpose in life is, as a dog. The movie starts out with one of the dogs sometime in the 1940s and continues on through present day as each dog is reborn. In the movie, the dog is voiced by Josh Gad, who also voiced Olaf in Frozen. Dennis Quaid plays the dog's ""boy"" later on in the movie and really brings a lot of emotion to the story. This movie is about 100 minutes long and is rated PG.I was so excited to watch this movie that I pre-ordered it as soon as I saw it was available! I read the books just a couple months ago and the stories are still fairly fresh in my mind so I was able to recall most of the events pretty well. Overall, I LOVED the story. I'm more of a cat person but both my husband and I owned dogs growing up so we were able to identify with the dog's often humorous behaviors. I really enjoyed the story and laughed at the dog's witty comments and cried during sad times.The ONLY reason I didn't give this movie five stars is because some of the events appeared much different in the movie than in the book. I know that sometimes things are changed but I was mainly disappointed in the part with the German Shepard, Ellie. One of the dogs I had growing up was a German Shepard so I was most excited for this part and was disappointed to find out it had been changed quite a bit. Other than that, I felt the movie followed the book pretty closely and touched on most of the main points without becoming a really long movie.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie even though I was disappointed in one section of the movie. I didn't feel one particular section of the book was portrayed very accurately and I was only disappointed because that was the part I was looking forward to the most. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and laughed, cried, and smiled, just like I did with the book. There wasn't any animal abuse or violence and the movie only showed a slight portion of neglect. I also feel this movie is a good family movie. My twins are four and really only interested in animated movies at the moment but I would allow them to watch this one if they were interested. If you are interested in the books and the movie, I highly recommend reading the books first and then watching the movie. Just be aware that Ellie's story is shown differently. If you are mainly interested in the movie and love dogs, you will love this movie!","4.0 "

"A Dog's Purpose","This will be a forever favorite for me!","AmazonShopper","I'll start by saying, **Book Before Movie**. No movie can ever fit everything from the book, into allotted movie run times, so reading the book will fill in what some may see as missing parts/questions.  This movie is fantastic!  It will have you laughing out loud, you'll shed some tears (my husband even shed quite a few), and will warm your heart.  It's a touching story, about the bond between a dog, and their human (which all dog lovers can relate to).  There were many instances where I related something to one of my pups (present, and past).  I don't want to write anything that would be a 'spoiler', so I'll just say that this is a must see, and I will be watching it many more times. 6 stars, on the 5 star scale.  My pups also gave their approval, as they were glued to the tv, so my husband & I had to move to look around them. We'd get them to lay down & watch, then they'd be back up right in front of the tv again.  This family/pack is marking this as one of our all time favorite movies!","5.0 "

I consider it deeply true that the companionship of animals is one of our saving graces in life.  Their lives are so short and precious.  It simply cannot be random, or a coincidence, that they are here, but for a reason, just like us.  This movie's premise is that the purpose of their lives is just to be there, with us, and for us.  It illustrates that quite beautifully, and touchingly.  I have always been engaged by animals as actors.  This movie captured the great emotion shown on their faces and in their actions.  One could feel the connection between them and their humans.  I am certain it will be of great inspiration to anyone who has ever loved a pet, or even admired their devotion.","5.0 "

"A Dog's Purpose","Terribly disappointing","Running Deer","I loved the book--it's charming and heartfelt and full of nuances and humor. The film is awful--none of the characters are developed well, and the dog him/herself has simply become an add-on with occasional voiceovers. All of the depth of the book is gone, and while I understand that there are time limitations in films, that's really no excuse for this preposterous version of the story. There are so many changes to the original story that seem to have been made to give us stereotypical, stock characters with superficial motivation in order to advance the plot, but the real result is a weak narrative with unsympathetic characters and no real development at all. If you love the book avoid this dreck. If you've never read the book, you may find it interesting in a shallow, bad-TV-movie sort of way. There's nothing creative or even caring here at all--and they even change the dog's purpose!","1.0 "

But both my husband and experienced our favorite scenes with spontaneous tears, his for the police dog who risked his life, and mine for the dog who befriended the isolated college student who eventually found her way, with her dog as support.  As for the scene that supposedly put a canine actor in danger, this is a quick scene, the dog is swimming, and my husband, who is quite sensitive about dogs, was not upset.  This scene appears to have been created largely by the placement of the cameras and editing.  I appreciate the way the movie gets you to thinking about the role of human/canine relationships, and how we form bonds with animals that add continuity to our lives, and support in times of transitions.","4.0 "

"A Dog's Purpose","A Dog Lovers Must Watch, It Will Tugg At Ya Heart Strings And Make Ya Laugh All At The Same Time.","SgtDre","As I started to watch A Dog's Purpose I will be honest in that I did not know what to expect, I Just Heard of this movie a few days ago and then I get an e-mail from Amazon about New movies, when I opened the e-mail up the first and only thing I saw was the picture of the Dog. So I to watching it right away, I Laughed, I cried, I laughed, this movie had me on a Roller Coaster kind of a ride and through out the movie I kept thinking about my Dog Thor Who Passed away about 13 years ago in my arms, He was first Dog an Akita (picture Attached) you knew when he was walking or running with his BIG paws Thumping and is it at the end where I broke down. If only I thought to my self, I now I have a Jack Russell and he is my shadow, where I go in the house he is right behind me can't tell how many times I turned around and tripped over him, just like Baily in the this movie but he was much bigger. Where my Little White Gate Jack Russell is much smaller and quieter, and yes Just love your dog and live through his eyes, just roll with it if they do something they should not or get rambunctious, they just happy to be with ya and around ya and yes Play with ya. I learned the hard way and took things much to seriously with (Thor) was always working 50 to 80 hours a week and hardly took the time to really love and enjoy his company.And that is why this movie really hit home for me, It hit with a lot of What if's? I read in another review that there's book this movie was made from, I know there is no way a movie can be like a the book it would hours long and no way that people would sit through it, yet I feel they did a fairly good job compressing the book version down to a movie of this length, that is if the movie is base on a book? Even towards last few minutes and the very end it was so telling at what was going to happen, I could see it coming a mile away, but even with that in mind I can't fault the way it was done for time, some may say that it was rushed to get to the ending but at one hour and forty minutes, its a good length for a movie of this kind. I sure did like it and enjoyed it, I know that I put a fair amount of my own of life as Dog owner and lover, but it just mirrored things for me just a little bit with the silly things my Dog does and that is what this movie will do for Dog Lovers if you think about it after watching this movie, I'm sure many will find themselves thinking about their dog and what they have done.When I started watching the movie, my younger daughter ""20 yr old"" and I actually got in a bit of heat discussion, she started talking about how she saw ""A / few"" video(s) on you tube that the dogs were abused when making this movie. I paused the movie and had her show me what she saw, and so I took doing my own research that she failed to do, and It turned out that the video is not even two minutes long and a well known animal rights group started recruiting people to boycott this movie, and without the context of what was being shown in what looks like a short cell phone video clip. The truth is the trainers were told to something completely different from what the dog was trained for and it seems like either the producers or directors wanted to change things up. And when you have a dog trained for weeks and some times months then in mid stream you put that same dog in a completely different situation that it never trained for it will not want to or have a hard time doing so. So it turned out that is exactly what happened after reading the public statement from the company that was hired to work with and train the dogs, NOW this is something that I do know and understand very well.I spent many hours days and weeks training my dog(s) it's not easy and you have to take the time and make the effort to know when to push the training and when not to, not to mention once the dog is trained it will follow it's training, ""keep in mind police and military dogs"" they take the dogs from just about under 1 yr old and start working with and training them, and once they are certified to go in the field and ready to work at whey were trained for, they could be 2 + yrs old. And it's even longer for seeing eye dogs, not all or every dog will buck or change on the fly from it's predetermined training and that is what they tried to do and failed it, once they knew that they went back to what the dog was trained for, at this point I'm talking about the police dog part of this movie and it did involve water. And NO the dog did not get hurt in the water, it did just what it was trained to do and very well I might add, the dog did what I never saw a dog do or ever heard of doing, It really amazed me because I don't think I would have the courage to do what the dog did from where it did from it, well as it was shown in the movie that is.Lastly I would like to ad a little bit more of my story, when my younger daughter was born, with my wife home with my older special needs daughter and I was at work from 8 am to around 9pm or 11pm on many nights, my dog ""Thor"" slept under the bassinet of my younger daughter for around two weeks. And I never thought of even training him to do that he just did it, as told to me by my wife, not to mention on one occasion when I was very tired and dozed off on the sofa, my wife in the basement doing laundry. She had locked the from outer daughter, but some how my older special needs daughter took it upon herself to take ""Thor"" for a walk with he leash mind you and Thor stayed with never pulling or trying to run off, he stayed with her they walked side by side for a block and half, until my wife saw she was gone the front outer door open, and at this time ""Thor"" was about a yr and half old mind you.So, yes Dogs will amaze you, Daze you, make you laugh, make you cry, make you angry, frustrate you, but they will always Love you unconditionally, when you have good or bad days, and they will know and will always brighten your day when you least expect it. And surprise you when you least expect it, and this what the movie does, show you from the dogs eye view of what they could be or might be thinking or wanting to do to make you happy and give you love with licks on your face and at times right after they just finished grooming them selves and I will it at that, on that point that is. And keep the meat sticks well above the dogs head, I / we learned this a few times when our ""White Gate"" Jack Russell snatched a piece of food right out our hands when we least expected it, yes they can be very sneaky that is for sure.So When you watch this movie, remember to love and care for your dog, but on the same hand remember where is it and or doing as you watch this movie, because while this movie will make you laugh and and even shed a tear and give you a new view of how dogs look at you and want to be with you and love you, Well at least that is how I looked at it, with a hole new perspective. Sit back and enjoy the movie with the family.","5.0 "

"A Dog's Purpose","Dogs make everything better.","J. Schuck","I saw bad reviews for this movie and the controversy over the video of the dog supposedly being stressed filming the water rescue scene, (which was later debunked as edited and faked), but my daughter really wanted to see this so we went.  After seeing the movie, I can't for the life of me figure out where the bad reviews are from.  This is a wonderful, positive story.  Maybe the ""professional"" reviewers didn't like the ""simplistic"" human characters.  They must have forgotten that the story is told from the dog's perspective and anyone who has ever had a dog knows that they have a pretty simplistic view of the world.  Happiness to them is being fed everyday and having someone to play with and who loves them.  Anything beyond that is unimportant.Maybe they didn't like the ""Disney-esque"" happy ending.  With all the negative that has been flying around and is still flying around and all the name-calling and hatred-slinging, I for one could use a story that had no political leanings whatsoever and it's only message was ""A dog makes everything better.""","4.0 "

He got so tired of me yelling at the TV, and I don't blame him. The screenplay seemed to be a sappy knockoff of the book, but the tone and story line were so different--- I really didn't understand why it was necessary and feel the screenplay did a disservice to the author. So much was left out or changed that it removed all the depth and layers of the story. If I saw the movie first, I would have never been tempted to read the book---it seemed geared to small children.  Can't recommend the movie, but do recommend the book.","2.0 "

This film shows brief episodic snapshots of a dog being reincarnated several times.  Each episode was superficial. The humor was flat and the pace way too rapid.  The segment on K9 units went by in a blink.  This film is not even in the same league as ""Call of the Wild"", ""Old Yeller"", or ""Far From Home"".

"A Dog's Purpose","Bad life?  No problem just die.","Dr9","Beautifully well shot.  But lacked story.  I wouldn't recommend this for younger viewers.[SPOILER - I guess]The dog is re-incarnated a few times.  Which makes for mini-stories, but this isn't an anthology, the stories don't connect.  You could swap out the order of a few or omit them and not make a difference.  One sequence was "" I remember I was born, and that's it"" one of his/her (their gender changes?) lives the puppy was euthanized quickly.  The 'Wonder Years' voiceover effect gets old pretty quick.While for pet owners it is a somewhat narcissistic view that an 'old pet came back to be'  - once you introduce reincarnation it kind of takes all the stakes away.  Bad life?  No problem just die.Again, not a good movie for kids.  Some sad movements and the movie struggles to give the main dog an arc.  The dogs purpose is basically to serve humans.  Sucks for them I guess.What young adult/kids movies that deal with loss with a fantasy elements would I suggest?  How about ""Babe"", ""Charolette's Web"", ""Bridge to Teribithia"" or for older kids ""A Monster Calls"".  Any of those is a hundred times better movie, more deapth, and much more watchable for adults..","1.0 "

If you love dogs, this movie will tug on your heartstrings and make you fondly remember the dogs you've loved and lost, as well as celebrate the dogs currently in your life. If you don't have a dog in your life right now, this movie will make you want to go out and rescue one. And if you don't love dogs... then I don't know what your deal is, you've got problems.It's a feel-good film that you can bring the whole family to see, and everyone will leave the theater happier than when they arrived. A touching and satisfying adaptation of the wonderful book by W. Bruce Cameron. If you read the book, you'll love the movie. If you didn't read the book, you'll still love the movie, but do go out and get yourself a copy to read, whether before or after seeing the film.I've seen it twice so far, once on opening night and once the following week.

Saving Private Ryan, just sensitizes me to the extreme cost that soldiers and their loved ones have to pay in a war. ""The Descendants"" made me cry and realize how death in a family can bring people together. And so on.""A Dog's Purpose"" is a sad movie with no larger message. Characters suffer through pain, loneliness, general misfortune and death. The only larger message that I could gather was that dogs can help people who are otherwise lonely. But then the dogs die.

Bruce Cameron, who by the way with his wife, were screenwriters for the movie, its a tail, er tale of love. A love letter to their humans about their purpose in our lives. Yes, you will cry, but they are tears of love and you will laugh. Afterall, our dogs are goofballs. I would give this movie 10 stars if they were available. I have seen this movie more than once in theaters and love this story so much, that I want to have it in my collection. You will not be disappointed. After the first viewing, I came home and grabbed my dog's face in my hands, looked into his soul-filled eyes and asked ""who are you?, what is YOUR purpose and what is mine in yours."" As tears slipped down my cheeks remembering scenes from the movie, I realized the depth of the love I have for this dog and the dogs who came before him. Thank you W. Bruce Cameron and Cathryn Michon, Amblin Entertainment and Universal Pictures for bringing this story to the screen for everyone.","5.0 "

"A Dog's Purpose","Thought Provoking Film with Good Messages","KittyKins","I went to see the movie ""A Dog's Purpose"" this afternoon and actually was pleasantly surprised. I'd heard some negative things, but I think many of those things have been overblown. I know one thing that some people didn't like was the ""reincarnation"" theme, but watching the film I'd have to say that it's not really about that but about LIFE, the decisions we make, and how things often go full circle. It's also about how pets impact our lives. I'd say a piece of our first pet is in our next pet and so on, and so often they are angels in our lives. They may look different, but all dogs have the same perspective of living in the present, and are there to help us through the problems of life. If you can get past the dog coming back as other dogs and realize it's just fantasy they are presenting to pull the story together, you will actually find it to be a very thought provoking film. As humans we have so many things to live through and our pets are with us every step of the way, living it with us. I was nervous about going because dog movies seem to have one thing in common, the dog dies, but I found this to be a story of redemption and second chances. The negative content from my perspective was the occasional mildly crude humour and I think I heard God's name used once or twice. Usually they said ""gosh"". The acting was very well done and I found myself crying, not because of the dog as much as the people and the problems they faced. If only life could turn out as happily as it does in this film. I honestly loved it and parts were quite funny.","5.0 "

"A Dog's Purpose","Boring and Not Really as Advertised!","My Experience","After watching about 30 minutes of this film, I realized it was NOT at all what I expected.  I am a dog lover so I was taken in by the well written marketing experts who are anything but completely honest in their praise...but again they are not paid to be.  Sad isn't it?  Anyway, of the billions of people on this planet there will be those that love it and that's okay.  I found the screen play amateurish so the acting is difficult to pull off for the actors.  When I discovered that it lasted TWO hours I knew I couldn't endure that.  I was going to pass along to my daughter...who has three rescue dogs...for her family movie night.  After reading some of the more realistic reviews of this film, I doubt I will pass along.  Parts of it would not be appropriate  perceptions of life at it's best for young minds.

"A Dog's Purpose","I love dog movies and stories","John K Calkins","I love dog movies and stories. ""Where the Red Fern Grows"", ""Big Red"", are staples that I grew up reading, and later seeing. This movie seems to be missing something, or perhaps it is simply too long. The story is about a dog who, when it dies, transfers its personality to the next dog the owner and/or family gets, and follows the family through the changes that typically happen to families as they grow and mature. It is apparent what is going to happen after a couple of dog 'switches', and the movie seems to drone through so many switches that the viewer ends up relieved when the movie is over. The movie lacks any real crises that 'grip' the audience, and while there are comic moments, none of them were particularly memorable, either. To summarize, this movie just falls short of what one might have expected.","1.0 "

I was also a little worried that the movie would not do the book justice, because let's face it, they rarely do measure up.  If you don't like dogs, you won't like this movie.  If you do, get ready for an enjoyable hour and forty-five minutes worth.  There are some sad moments, some edge of your seat uncomfortable moments, and many laughing out-loud moments that will more than compensate the other parts.  It's a feel good movie, that's all I can say, and though the ending is different than the book, I loved it even better and give this movie 5-stars.  I read somewhere some negative review about the dog's voices not being different to match up with their different personalities, when the dog is reincarnated.  That's just a bunch of hog-wash, and so totally not important when you realize the story revolves around Bailey, who learns what his purpose in life is.","5.0 "

I never dreamt that there would be a good way to make this into a movie and still keep all the emotions  and sensations and imagination alive but the movie delivers all this and more! Anyone who has ever had a dog and have loved and lost many, there is hope inspired in this movie! You will laugh, you will cry and you will walk away with renewed hope and much happiness knowing our universe and spiritual walk through life is never-ending! Our fur babies are always our kindred spirits These Kindred Spirits met in life are truly much more than just our best friends we make during our time here. We connect at different levels of the consciousness. These connections can run through many lifetimes and shared soul lessons. These spirits (human or animal) are the touchstone of our purposes, the ones who help to give us energy, light, unconditional love and compassion. Finding a Kindred Spirit can save your life. It can be a friend, family member or even a beloved pet. We have pieces of puzzles that fit together when we find each other. Their light in our lives make us shine a little brighter.

Is this some sort of leftist, anti-animal nonsense? Or if it isn't political, then what is it? What is the obsession with dogs and death? Must we always be reminded that dogs die, just like all living creatures? Is it necessary to pound the whole ""rip your heart out"" thing into us every time a ""dog movie"" is made? Can't the darn dog just live for once and the movie end before the inevitable death? How about ending it with the dog, grayed around the muzzle, but still very alive, sleeping quietly in front of the fireplace as the camera pans out and the credits roll?You think watching a dog die ONCE in a movie is bad? Well, this one has 'em all beat! Because the underlying premise of this movie is ""dog reincarnation,"" the dog dies OVER AND OVER again! Really?

"A Dog's Purpose","""A Dog's Purpose"" is pretty good.","Kris King","""A Dog's Purpose"" is pretty good.

The film editing by Robert Leighton is pretty good. The casting by John Papsidera is pretty good. The production design by Michael Carlin is pretty good.

I'll watch this over and over.  Anyone who has had a special relationship with their canine children can attest to the fact that dogs can express a wide range of emotions.  Too bad PETA made the false animal abuse claim.  The film deserved a better reception.  The truth finally came out that PETA had once again edited a video to make it an animal abuse claim for publicity purposes.  In this case, that Hercules almost drowned on the film set.

"A Dog's Purpose","POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS! BETTER THAN I EXPECTED IT BE!","The Monster Kid","A Dog's Purpose was a film I wasn't sure I was going to like. I knew it would be sentimental, I knew it would tug at the heart strings, I knew it had the potential to be one of the most morbid films ever made. The idea of watching a cute dog die over and over again could have been an exercise in the  maudlin, depressing to say the least, but the filmmakers wisely chose to keep the tone light and breeze through them with a more comical touch.I was surprised how much I liked this film, predictable? Absolutely, but entertaining and surprisingly well executed. Is it going to win awards, I doubt it, nor should it. That doesn't make it any less enjoyable to those who read the synopsis and found it interesting enough to want to see it.The human characters are simplistic, but interesting enough, the story is told through the dog and while character development is simple it is fleshed out enough to work within the storyline. Manipulative? Hmmm... of course it is, but aren't all these types of films guilty of that? The very fact that you are sitting down to watch a movie about a dog dying repeatedly and being reborn numerous times, you should know what you're getting yourself into. Will you ball your eyes out? No, a tear or two, yes. It's a sweat good natured film that is worth seeing if this is your cup of tea.I have read many negative reviews about animal abuse in this film, but after some research it all appears to be baloney. I don't want to get into a debate with animal abuse activist, but I would hope in this day and age at least when a studio who can convince known actors to be associated with their film that a standard has to be kept on such things. As far as animal being stressed out, well, life is stressful folks, everyone has stress and on some level every living thing does too. I'm sure a squirrel has stress every time it goes out of its dwelling to get something to eat. I think the important thing to realize is that films are edited and what you see on screen may be completely different from that what actually happened during shooting.A Dog's Purpose is not something I will probably watch again (okay maybe someday), but I enjoyed the sentimental ride while I was recovering from a cold. :-D","4.0 "

"A Dog's Purpose","I realized that today I truly understood my purpose not just to find people but to save them","JWINK","This movie reminds me in some ways of one of my favorite movies starring a dog as the main character, My Dog Skip.  Although I won’t say that I liked this one better than Skip, this movie was better than I expected it to be.A Dog’s Purpose is one of those feel good, pull at your heart strings movie similar in a lot of way to Skip with the difference being that this movie goes through Bailey’s different incarnations as he lives through several lifetimes with different families before ultimately finding home.  The main story involves Ethan and his struggles growing up with an alcoholic father.  I think some of the other connected stories of Bailey’s lives work a bit better than others but ultimately, I found the movie to be entertaining and well done.  I still don’t get the controversy about the movie as I didn’t see anything that was cruel or mean to the animals portrayed.This is a great family movie, it is sad in some parts but with its portrayal of the cruelty of life that sometimes is with humans and animals but also made me smile a lot too as it made me think of the pets I had as a child and how I still miss them.  The story is predictable and some of the characters (especially those in the other lives portions) a bit lacking in character development but still I found the movie to be nicely done overall with a meaningful message for us humans too.If you are a pet lover or have had pets growing up, then you will most likely like this movie as well as this being a good family movie as well.4 stars","4.0 "

AN ANIMAL ""OWNER"" DOESN'T MEAN YOU AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFY.","CAM","I want to preface my review by saying that my wife and I are owned by 3 abandoned dogs that rescued us and they are the sunshine in our lives and it would be impossible to imagine life without them. It's hard to believe that anyone with a pulse could/would leave anything less than a 5 star review of this movie. It ripped at my heart so much that I had to wait over a week to leave this review.While watching this, I couldn't stop remembering all the dogs I had as a young kid that were so loyal to me and I can't remember what happened to them. They are with us for such a short time and  give us such unconditional love but still the majority of us take them for granted and can't even remember most of their names. It makes me sick to think about all the innocent animals that are discarded like yesterday's trash and worse to think about all the sick people that abuse them.","5.0 "

I was scared to watch it because I cant stand to see any thing bad happen to an animal in any movie! That being said, yes there is are a couple sad parts but it is not so heartbreaking that you can't move on...and the story continues to happier times.  Sorry, don't think I spoiled it.

It hit me in all the right feels.

This is the most pro-rescue movie to ever come out of Hollywood! I am an passionate animal lover and volunteer with our shelter and numerous rescues. I promise you will not be disappointed in this movie! I drove 5 hours round trip to see an early screening of it (which benefited a rescue of course) and now will be taking my kids, sister-in-law and friend to the theater tomorrow so they can all see it!!

"A Dog's Purpose","As a rescuer I absolutely LOVED this movie","Kim Warren","As a rescuer I absolutely LOVED this movie.  It gave the dog a voice..humanized him/her if you will.  If this movie makes just one person go outside and bring in their chained dog, or pick that ""unadoptable"" dog at the shelter and give them a chance, or keep their dog until the very end and be there as they take their last breath it will be the best movie ever, in my opinion.  Too many of the dogs I have rescued were in the position they were in because people don't see them as anything more than an object to be played with for a while, easily disposed of.  This gives voice to the personality and, dare I say it, the soul of the dog.  Highly recommend this movie...take your friends..give it to the neighbor with the chained dog. They won't watch it? Give it to their kids.","5.0 "

"A Dog's Purpose","The Novel Was A Masterpiece, Easily the Best Dog Novel Ever Written. Movie is Okay But This Isn't the Best Dog Film Ever Made","James N Simpson","The novel that this movie is based on, I think anyone who has read it will agree with me and tell you, it is the greatest dog, especially events told through the mind of a dog, novel ever written.  Unfortunately although a perfectly watchable movie, you can't say the same thing about this DVD.  The movie is certainly no masterpiece, and there's plenty of dog movies out there, a lot better than this one.  Although it retains the skeleton of the plot of the novel, it certainly rushes a lot of the content, there really isn't much screen time devoted to the non Ethan storylines.  For example the third life of the dog, where it becomes a police dog starts at the 49 minute mark (Ethan storyline pretty much the whole film up to then other than a brief blink and you'll miss it life before), and is over in less than ten minutes.  In the novel that was the better of the canine narrator's careers. It was the most interesting one, we don't experience much of his training younger body of the dog years, and on the job, there's not much we experience either. It was actually more about the owner, a sad sack type who doesn't socialise with other humans.  Then the next life he's a corgi and has pretty much the same owner, only this time the owner is female, has darker skin and is a student who you guessed it, doesn't want to interact with other humans.  The final body story seemed a bit rushed compared to the book and has the same cheesy ending.Overall though the movie suffered from not having the one factor that made the book the masterpiece it was.  It wasn't told from the point of view of the dog.  Sure there are some voiceovers from time to time as the voiced mind of the dog by Josh Gad, but mostly we follow events watching Ethan and the other humans like we're a fly on the wall type viewing experience, Bailey and the other dog lives are just a sidekick.  Josh Gad voice was very recognisable from other films, he sounds and talks smoothly in English like a human, and knows too much of the human world from the start.  The book worked because he didn't understand human sentences and had to learn what words meant. They really should have put a Go-Pro camera on the head of a dog and filmed most of the movie that way so we would have seen everything as a dog would see it. Granted that would have been harder to film as dogs are unpredictable and who knows what crew it would have looked at from time to time.  But the novel it was based on deserved that extra effort. We still could have had some looking at the dog moments in the film, but really A Dog's Purpose the novel was about life told from a dog's point of view.Some factors such as in the police story you could tell the bad guy being bitten had one of those arm protector things under his shirt that you see in police dog training videos.  The older versions of some human characters such as Ethan didn't look like their younger actor selves.  Ethan's nose for example isn't consistent in size and the difference is quite noticeable.","3.0 "

Being a dog lover, there were times I just wanted to hug my dogs and hold them tight. There were times I laughed out loud. There were times I sat with tears running down my cheeks. Anyone who has a dog, or has ever had a dog, will identify with the characters in some way. So glad I rented this movie. So worth my time!","5.0 "
"A Dog's Purpose","A film that's hard for dog lovers to resist...","The Movie Man","“A Dog’s Purpose,"" based on the bestselling novel by W. Bruce Cameron, is the touching story of one devoted dog (voiced by Josh Gad) who discovers the meaning of his own existence through the lives of the humans he teaches to laugh and love. The concept of the film is that dogs are constantly reincarnated in other breeds and with differing temperaments.We follow the lives of a stray pup, a red retriever named Bailey in the 1960s and 70s, Ellie, a German Shepherd K-9 police dog, Tino, a small 80s corgi, and finally Buddy, a neglected St. Bernard with a long road home. What ever the shell, however, it’s always Bailey inside, retaining all the memories and experiences along the way. Bailey constantly ponders the meaning of life and the reason why he is where he is. Is it merely to have fun? To make humans happy? Finally, he settles on living for the moment, an appropriate code to live by if you’re a dog.The movie paints a rosy picture of mid-20th-century America in the sequence with Bailey, even though it does have its darker edges with a father too dependent on alcohol to make up for frustrations at work and a chaotic dinner party. The other sequences deal with tales of canine heroism or dedication reminiscent of the vintage TV show, “Lassie.” Director Lasse Hallstrom (“The Cider House Rules”) incorporates lots of humor well as some sad moments but, overall, the film is a tribute to the simple animals we bring into our lives who love us unconditionally, but leave us too soon.The human cast includes Dennis Quaid, Peggy Lipton, Bryce Gheisar, K.J. Apa and Juliet Rylance.Bonus extras on the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include deleted scenes, outtakes, and the featurettes “Lights, Camera, Woof!” and “A Writer’s Purpose.” A digital HD copy is included.","5.0 "

One of the dogs from the film was completely TERRIFIED to go into a pool that was simulating rushing water from a river. They were trying to force the poor dog who had his tail between his legs to go into the rapid water, and as he tried dug his nails onto the edge of the pool to keep from being tossed in, the damn trainer picked the dog up and forced him into the water!!! The video cuts off in the midst of commotion as someone screams that the dog was drowning and they had to rush in after him. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING AND UNACCEPTABLE! ESPECIALLY a movie that is supposed to be light hearted and about dogs. Who knows what else went on during filming. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.","1.0 "

No animal deserves this treatment. And where does the dog go after he is abused this way? Most likely in a cage to await his next horrid stunt. It is no secret many animals are abused or even killed during the making of these movies while movie goers watch without ever knowing the animals fate afterwards.I give this movie a zero rating as being typical of what Really happens to animals during the making of these so call box busters.

"A Dog's Purpose","Close, But No Hachi","Carl Schultz","Very few movies seek to establish an emotional connection with the audience.  All too often, a trip to the movies begins to resemble a soulless business transaction rather than an artistic or emotional investment:  Three scares, six chuckles, two jump-out-of-your-seats, five thrills, and a dozen laughs?  That’ll be nine-fifty please.  And do you want that with or without popcorn?One recent picture which seeks to establish such an emotional link, albeit with some apparent indifference, is “A Dog’s Purpose,” produced by Amblin Entertainment—Steven Spielberg’s company—in association with Walden Media and Reliance Entertainment, and released by Universal Pictures.According to the Box Office Mojo website, which keeps track of such matters, “A Dog’s Purpose” has earned over $50 million in gross receipts at the box office in the four weeks since its release on January 27.  While that might seem like a paltry sum in relation to the standards set by, say, “Star Wars” or the latest release inspired by the Marvel Comics conglomerate, $50 million still represents an enormous number of tickets sold, especially for a family-friendly live-action movie about pets.Based on the acclaimed bestselling 2010 novel of the same name by humorist W. Bruce Cameron—the same author, by the way, who wrote “Eight Simple Rules for Dating my Teenage Daughter,” the basis for the popular television comedy from the early 2000s—“A Dog’s Purpose” was adapted to the screen by Cathryn Michon, Audrey Wells, Maya Forbes, Wally Wolodarsky, and Cameron himself, and purports to depict a dog’s experiences and reincarnations through several lifetimes, and the animal’s attempts to discover purpose and meaning in each of those various lives.Since inventors began experimenting with telling stories through a series of photos simulating movement, the relationship between humans and animals, particularly dogs, has been a popular subject of filmed entertainment, from Charlie Chaplin’s “A Dog’s Life” a century ago through Disney’s “Old Yeller” in 1957 and “Greyfriars Bobby” in 1961 and the genuinely affecting and heartbreaking “Hachi: A Dog’s Tale” in 2009.The Swedish filmmaker Lasse Hallstrom first appeared in American radar through his popular 1985 feature “My Life as a Dog.”  And while that imported coming of age comedy actually had fairly little to do with people and their canine companions, the title itself would be a reasonably accurate subtitle for Hallstrom’s “A Dog’s Purpose.”  Hallstrom coincidentally also directed the superb “Hachi:  A Dog’s Tale,” mentioned earlier.Narrated by comic actor Josh Gad—whose voice children might recognize from his performance as the character Olaf, the snowman in Disney’s animated hit “Frozen”—“A Dog’s Journey” actually becomes more on an anthology picture than an uninterrupted narrative, and illustrates the animal’s various lifetimes from his rescue from an overheated car by a child during the 1950s to his bonding with a solitary farmer some six decades later.In between, the dog also experiences life as the partner of a Chicago K-9 officer and as a companion to a lonely college student, who with the animal’s gentle prodding and encouragement eventually becomes outgoing enough to begin dating, marry, and become a mother.“A Dog’s Purpose” reaches out and touches the viewer in precisely the same spot in the heart which causes misty eyes and a lump in the throat when listening to Peter, Paul, and Mary sing “Puff, the Magic Dragon.”  Directed by Hallstrom in a fairly straightforward and uninspired take-it-or-leave-it style, the picture requires the audience to work nearly as hard and invest as much as the filmmakers themselves in making the drama and comedy segments work.  And it does manage to work…although sometimes at the expense of the picture’s credibility, and often its originality.At one point, the dog inadvertently swallows a valuable coin one character intends to proudly display during a visit that very evening by his employer.  Naturally, the dog is befuddled by his owner’s hovering while waiting for the coin to reappear from the animal’s other end—a situation which has been investigated countless times in other movies and television comedies.  Any laughter produced by the sequence might be inspired more by the audience’s familiarity with the situation more than the sympathy felt for the characters involved in the picture.The trailers for the picture have been somehow more effective than the picture itself in actually delivering the sentimental tears the filmmakers seem to have all but promised to the audience.  In this way, “A Dog’s Purpose” at times resembles nothing less than a connect-the-dots puzzle, which the audience is asked to complete and color, and only then purchase from the filmmakers as an original work of art.During the film’s more moving sequences, the music soundtrack credited to Rachel Portman introduces weeping and sweeping violins as a means of reaching out to squeeze and wring at the viewer’s heart until the desired tears appear in the eyes.  The soundtrack is also variously cluttered with period hit recording by musicians such as Chubby Checker, Santana, the Bee Gees, and Simon and Garfunkel, mostly to anchor the various decades and eras the film includes.Clocking in at a flat 100 minutes, the PG-rated film does touch on a few more important topics, such as loyalty, responsibility, and the importance of long-term relationships.  Parents bringing young children to a screening should be aware that some more mature topics are introduced during the picture’s running time:  One character over the years becomes an abusive alcoholic, and other scenes are related to spousal abuse, euthanasia, the kidnapping of a child, and the mistreatment of animals.Relative to that topic, a film clip as heartbreaking as any in the picture has been in wide circulation on the TMZ website, allegedly depicting one of the film’s canine stars displaying cardinal reluctance to cooperate during one of the picture’s more dangerous sequences.  That scene required the animal to enter a controlled but turbulent water tank on a studio soundstage, for a segment of film to be electronically grafted onto location backgrounds to appear that the dog is rescuing a child from drowning in the Chicago River.Although the TMZ footage has been denounced as fabricated by the filmmakers and similarly debunked at least sufficiently to introduce a reasonable doubt in the matter by the American Humane Association, which monitored the treatment animals involved during the production of “A Dog’s Purpose,” the subject matter is still upsetting.  Still, the controversy appears to have been for naught, as more is implied than depicted during that harrowing sequence.  Except for the insertion one or two brief close-up shots, at no point can either the animal or the child be clearly seen in the completed film.Still, the responsible parents of more sensitive children will find “A Dog’s Purpose” as a reason to introduce discussions in their families related to the picture’s more upsetting and troubling subjects.As such, “A Dog’s Purpose,” while flawed and mostly uninspired, is acceptable film fare for children and discerning adults, particularly parents.  Dogs, sadly, are not encouraged to attend.","3.0 "

"A Dog's Purpose","A Christian perspective","R. Donahue","It is clearly using strong emotional ties associated with having a dog to get children to sign on to accepting and believing in reincarnation! A movie with multiple deaths of dogs is in itself emotionally heartbreaking for an adult, no less a child. It is first and foremost an attack on Christianity. This will be a tug of war on the minds and hearts of children, any way the story is depicted.Based on the Bible, it is certain that reincarnation is a deadly lie; eternity awaits the human soul after death. There is a real Heaven and a real Hell, and God judges who will ultimately go to each after their death. The Satanic fraud of reincarnation (cyclic existence, transmigration of souls, past and future lives) has deceived millions of people, including Buddhists, Hindus, Jainists, Sikhs, Rosicrucians, Kabbalahists, and more. Instead of believing the truth about Creation in paradise, man’s fall to sin, the entrance of death into the world, and God’s plan of salvation, they accept a counterfeit—and reject the Creator’s gracious gift of eternal salvation. The result is eternal death. Learn more about what the Bible says about REINCARNATION -gotquestions.org","1.0 "

"The Shape of Water","Guillermo del Toro's latest creature feature is a good one, flush with ""R"" rated romance.","M. Oleson","Theater review.  Possible spoilers.  While watching this film in a sparsely populated multiplex theater, a few people began to walk out midway through the movie.  I’ve seen this before and I always find myself guessing why.  I mean what were they expecting?  My guess with this film is that it is a tale of fantasy.  One involving romance with a humanoid-like creature but clearly not human.  I’m sure everyone knows of the numerous iterations of “Beauty and the Beast” but don’t get upset.  Maybe the difference is that this film is pretty graphic, not only with the brutality of beast’s captivity but of the bold sexual context.Guillermo del Toro’s beast this time is a South American river creature considered a god by the local population.  The creature is played by Doug Jones and resembles another character created by del Toro and played by Jones in “Hellboy II.” He has a dual lung composition which allows him to spend time out of water, but he prefers being in it.  The web-handed (and footed) creature was captured by Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon in another great performance), an instrument of the U. S. government.  It’s 1962 and the military believes there may be some benefit to studying the creature and its potential powers.The large facility where the creature is kept includes a cleaning crew.  One of the cleaning ladies is Elisa Esposito (an Oscar-worthy performance by Sally Hawkins) who can hear but cannot speak due to some mysterious mishap many years earlier.  Her best friend and fellow cleaner is Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer) provides plenty of dialog to offset Elisa’s mute.  Elisa, while not speaking still communicates fully using facial gestures and her own form of sign language.  Michael Stuhlbarg plays Dr. Hoffstetler, the primary scientist responsible for studying the creature.Sides are quickly set as Strickland who is a bully, a thug and a sexual predator throws his weight around using a cattle prod as his reinforcement.  Hoffstetler, like most movie scientists is more interested in studying the creature not torturing him.  He has other secrets that will come into play later.  Elisa lives over a movie theater and her friend and neighbor is a gay man named Giles (Richard Jenkins) who like Elisa is love-starved and struggles to make ends meet as an artist for an advertising firm.Elisa is curious more than anything about the captive creature and slowly begins to approach him when he’s in his water tank, constrained around the neck.  The fact that the two beings must communicate non-verbally makes it all seem to make sense.  The creature, while not handsome by human sensibilities, has a certain character doesn’t make him repulsive.  Over time, the two become close.  When it becomes clear the creature will be killed and dissected, Elisa and her friends chart a plan to free him.Screenwriting chores are from del Toro and Vanessa Taylor.  Del Toro has admitted he based the story on his love of the movie “Creature from the Black Lagoon” which he first saw as a 6-year old.  It’s one of my favorite movies too.  Certainly the resemblance between the creatures in the films differ primarily from the advanced costume designs of today.  I was a bit puzzled by the amount of time Elisa had to keep the creature under wraps before freeing him back into the water.  Under the circumstances it seemed odd, not to mention dangerous.  Still, I guess it allows time for the unusual heightening of the romantic angle.  There is another scene in the film which might make some people slap their forehead in bewilderment, but like the whole movie, just go with it.  After all it’s a fairy tale for grown-ups and a sensitive one at that.  While del Toro’s imagination is primarily responsible for it all, it is Hawkins who makes it work.  Recommended…for most people.","4.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Could not have asked for anything more!","Helen","My husband and I loved this. Perhaps the difference from some reviewers is that I enjoy reading the genre of romance and basically this is an amazing, romantic fairytale. It had all the elements I need to enjoy a great HEA. We have the sad and lonely heroine, the strong and supportive best friends (Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins), the tortured (in this case literally, tortured) hero, and the unrepentant villain. Michael Shannon made a fabulous bad guy, really embodying everything vile. He was a horrible, self-absorbed, arrogant, racist, chauvinistic jerk and it was enjoyable to watch him disintegrate (again literally and figuratively) as the movie progressed. I always like the bad guy to loose big in the end!Some reviewers mention bestiality but I think they are seriously missing the point here. This fantasy challenges us to rethink our own self-absorbed, arrogance.

"The Shape of Water","A Fine Film - 5 Stars","BookWorm21","I loved nearly every moment of this movie. Sally Hawkins is a truly wonderful actress with a broad range of ability. She was perfect as Eliza. I think this is the kind of movie that you just need to let go and take it for face value. The multi-layered plot takes the viewer through a storyline that encompasses fantasy, romance, politics, and redemption. The characters and their relationships to one another are deep. We see characters living on the margins of society drawn in rich and vibrant tones with deep emotions. It is one of those movies that people who loved it will want to watch over and over again.","5.0 "
"The Shape of Water","A beautiful fairy tale with an unconventional relationship at its center","titania86","Elisa Esposito goes through the same routine every day, sleeping during the day and working at night at the Occam Aerospace Research Center in Baltimore as a cleaning lady. She is mute due to scars around her neck from infancy and communicates with sign language. When the facility brings in an ""asset"" that turns out to be an amphibious man, Elisa is immediately fascinated. The creature is kept in shackles, cut, electrocuted, suffocated, and all other manner of torture inflicted by the military, spearheaded by Colonel Richard Strickland. Elisa spends as much time as she can with the amphibious man, introducing him to music, feeding him hardboiled eggs, and teaching him sign language. When the military decides to terminate ""the asset,"" Elisa gets her few friends to attempt to free the man she fell in love with.Guillermo del Toro's vision is always exciting, fresh, and steeped in horror. The Shape of Water is another fairy tale film for adults that deals with love in unexpected places, outcasts, and the toxic nature of the patriarchy. Elisa is a generally cheerful person who goes through her daily life with few friends and simple pleasures. As a cleaning lady, she can't afford lavish things, but manages to make the things within her means special. Most of the people in her life dismiss her out of hand due to her mute nature, but her true friends, who are her neighbor Giles and her co-worker Zelda, treat her as they would anyone else. Giles is a struggling artist and closeted gay man in an era where coming out would mean losing everything. Zelda is a no-nonsense African American woman in a time of segregation and overt racism. Elisa finds kinship and respect with both of her friends despite how the world treats them and they find the same in her.The amphibious man is essentially the Creature from the Black Lagoon. He was taken from a river in South America where he was worshipped as a god. In the US, the military abuses and tortures him. They only find value in a dissection of the creature to find out how it works even though he may be the only one of his kind. The Russians, on the other hand, care more about destroying the creature to keep the knowledge from the Americans. The amphibious man has intelligence and the ability to learn along with animalistic instincts and behaviors. He is in between human and animal with traits of both. His relationship with Elisa starts off as friendship and progresses to attraction and love. Their relationship will never be a conventional one, but they make each other happy and that's all that really matters. Elisa and her friends, along with a Russian double agent who values the man over his country, break the amphibious man out of the lab in a half baked, pulse pounding heist. His life at Elisa's home has some hiccups, but is generally beneficial until his health starts to decline.The villain of this piece is Colonel Richard Streckland, a man completely confident in himself. He treats those he views under him like garbage shown when he unabashedly pisses on the floor in front of Elisa and Zelda who just cleaned. Racism and sexism color his point of view and he tosses out comments no matter who is present. The patriarchal society has told him his whole life that he is worthy, special, and above everyone else. The scene at the car dealership encompasses this when the salesman feeds him a line about being a man of the future. Streckland falls for it and buys the car because it's in line with what he's been fed his whole life. When he loses the ""asset"" to what he thinks is a sophisticated Black Ops team, his whole career, all that he's worked for his whole life, could be destroyed. The creature bit off his fingers early in the film and those slowly necrotizing digits symbolize his fall and his self perceived value influenced by the patriarchy. He rips off those fingers in a fit of rage, showing that he will find the creature and destroy it even if it means destroying himself as well. Streckland could have easily been a one dimensional villain, but his motivation and reasoning give him dimension.The Shape of Water is an absolutely beautiful film with love and friendship right alongside violence and cruelty. Fantasy exists with harsh reality and social issues that are still relevant today. Every performance is exceptional, especially Richard Jenkins as Giles and Michael Shannon as Colonel Streckland. The pacing is a little unexpected, but perfect in retrospect. The mystery of the creature isn't dwelled upon because we all know what it is. More time is dedicated to getting to know all the characters, building up their relationship, and moving the plot along. Guillermo del Toro made a wonderful movie with a bizarre premise and makes it a touching, emotional work of art.","5.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Doesn't work and here's why","Kirk Chen","The problem with this movie is not the relationship between humanoid amphibian and Hawkins's character. After all, this has worked in Beauty and Beast, ET, etc. The problem is that too little effort is made to flesh out the creature. We know he likes hard boiled eggs, and?? I can't latch on to much to relate to him.On the other hand, a lot of time is devoted to the bad guy (wife and kids, buying a car, a racist, etc.) I get it that he's a hypocrite in a hypocritical age (the 1950s). The movie makers wants to give him more layers. But in the end, he's just a traditional villain with no redeeming feature. So it's a waste of time.","2.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Decency doesn't matter","ldemar","""Decency doesn't really matter.  We sell it; but it's an export.  We sell it because we don't use it.""The above line at minute 1:36 of the movie, eloquently summarizes the theme of the movie and many movies coming out these days, both fiction and nonfiction.  It's the idea that government and coporatocracy sell decency but do not actually practice it.  Decency as PR stunt vs the individual who (almost) powerless to defend themselves, at some point, risks all to hang on to heart and love and decency.This is a very dark theme.  And really difficult to stomach, especially for me who has lost a loved one to a predatary business model that still plasters the country with it's ""decent"" slogans, billboards, and radio commericals.But Del Torro threw me a life line from that very dark place by sharing this poem at the end:""Unable to perceive the shape of you, I find you all around me and your presence fills my eyes with your love.  It humbles my heart for you are everywhere.""This movie is a reminder of the power of love and that love is eternal.","5.0 "
"The Shape of Water","The Shape of Guillermo del Toro","M. Guzman","There are many ways to tell a truth. It can be directly, through symbolism, or simply from satire. The cinema, in its narrative omnipotence, appropriated them and has played to mix them in all possible ways. From great directors we have seen a few good combinations, and one of them is, without a doubt, Guillermo del Toro.In 2006 we were surprised by del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth (El Laberinto del Fauno), a fable set in midst of the Spanish Civil War. Twelve years later, the Mexican director is back in form, this time with The Shape of Water (La Forma del Agua). The film may very well be this year's best, but not only due to the Academy's 13 nominations.This fable, although with suspicious similarities in his narrative technique with Pan's Labyrinth as the two share a similar ""structural formula"", makes you fall in love and invites you to reflect upon its extraordinary script and cast. Of the latter stand out Sally Hawkin, Olivia Spencer, Richard Jenkins and the wonderful Doug Jones, the man behind the ""creature"".Things from this world have a common place, an ""aleph"", a space/time where they gather and be one and all at the same time. The history of the United States in the sixties. The Cold War, the not-so ""cold wars"": the struggles for civil rights, the unstoppable technological innovation, the entertainment industry, the American dream... that being the case, Guillermo del Toro could not find better setting for The Shape of Water.""Silence"" has a strong symbolism in this film as those who literally cannot speak are the two main characters: a mute woman (Elisa) and an non-speaking aquatic creature that fall in love. Little by little it is revealed that their friends (a black woman, a gay man and a scientist tied to ideological commitments) are also mute in a society that does not accept them.Elisa elegantly sums up all the others ""good"" characters, but del Toro takes her further and turns her into the hero of the story, one with no power other than the will to smash her loneliness. The silence remains in the film as a child of loneliness and not as an evil in itself.The monsters of Guillermo de Toro always have something interesting to say, especially this one, although it cannot speak. The Shape of Water are not only two hours of pure joy and entertainment, but an opportunity to immerse oneself in our thoughts through its symbolism. The word ""immerse"" has probably never been better used.","5.0 "

"The Shape of Water","A humane monster and monstrous humans","Carla Martin-Wood","I watched this last night and was overwhelmed. It's the most gorgeous, most elegantly strange, most romantic fairytale of a movie.  It's Cinderella. It's Beauty and the Beast. There are nods to various fairytales in the film, but it's not a movie for children. It's a humane monster and monstrous humans. It's gay rights. It's a brave and strong and capable woman who doesn't need her voice to make an indelible statement. It's surviving loneliness. It's human rights. It's tolerance vs intolerance. And KINDNESS -- real kindness and improbable love. It's  a spy novel. And a romantic fantasy. It asks us, ""What is human?"" And the sets look like you just entered another world -- a beautiful one set in 1962. It's the magickal elements of the heroine's home and the artist's home juxtaposed against the cruel, stark world where they work. There is just so much packed into one movie. It's why I MUST watch it again and again I think. And it leaves you with a surprise happily-ever-after that's just delightful. For those with kids, I wouldn't recommend that they watch till you've seen it and approve, since there are sexual elements and some well-deserved violence, though it's not the horrific kind we see in most films these days. I don't know when I've ever been just swept away or when I'll get the stars out of my eyes. Highly recommended","5.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Giles: ""It's not even human!""  Elisa: ""If we do nothing, neither are we.""","Whitt Patrick Pond","Directed by Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth) from a screenplay by del Toro and Vanessa Taylor (Game of Thrones, Everwood), The Shape of Water is, like so many of del Toro's films, in a category of its own. On the surface it's science fiction, but it's also a romance, a spy thriller and a character study. It helps if you're familiar with sci-fi films of the 1950's and early 60's, most particularly the 1954 classic film The Creature from the Black Lagoon. But this is The Creature from the Black Lagoon retold as a fantastically improbable love story, reminiscent in many ways of Spielberg's E.T.Set in the early 1960's, The Shape of Water begins at the secretive Occam Aerospace Research Center in Baltimore where Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) works as part of the janitorial staff.  Elisa is mute, the result of an injury sustained as an infant, but can hear just fine.  She communicates by using American Sign Language, relying on her friend and fellow janitor Zelda (Octavia Spencer) to interpret for her to everyone else.  Elisa lives in an apartment above a movie theater.  Her neighbor and friend in the adjoining apartment is Giles, is a talented but struggling middle aged artist who is also closeted and gay.One day OARC the receives delivery of a strange creature in a water tank, captured by Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) from a remote river in South America where the natives apparently worshipped it as some kind of river god. Strickland coldly refers to the creature as ""the Asset"" and ""an affront"" to God and nature.  But Elisa sees the creature (Doug Jones) in very different ways, first with curiosity, then, as time goes on, with increasing empathy.Highly recommended.","5.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Are you the only one?","Richard Owens","Polarizing. I've seen some reviews comparing this to Beauty and the Beast. Hmm - if you go to this movie expected a childish movie experience, or that the director or cast is going pull back to pacify your sensitivities, you will be disappointed. This is NOT a movie for children, it is NOT cutesy or weak. If you want cutesy, there are tons of projects out there that will meet your needs.So - let's look at THIS movie.What is love? We open with a study of a lonely woman, living a life of quiet desperation? Her routine is the same, get up, boil eggs, masturbate - [though contrary to many of the reviews - this latter is shown only as her with a leg out of the bathtub]. Of interest within the overall context of the movie is boiling eggs. [After all, it is the Shape of Water].We see this opening scene twice and it establishes who our main character is. She has an interesting apartment. Her neighbor has been discarded by a system he wants back into, and she is a janitress at some government facility.No, the government is not painted as ""your friend"" - the conversation between the ""bad guy"" and his boss shows exactly how ""the government"" thinks of it's people.It's a BIG movie - it brings in pieces and parts of our communal past - in ways that are not flattering. That is true. Our main character is plainish... not drop dead gorgeous but she has HEART and this is, at it's core a movie about HEART and the things we value.The ""bad guy"" is interesting, in a train wreck kind of way. He has gotten to where he is [where ever that is] by unswerving devotion and fanatical pursuit of doing what is asked of him. And by doing so, has achieved his version of the American dream.There are several key players, Bob, Zelda... her neighbor and in an odd way, the Creature.We are told it is ""him"" but that is not apparent. Yes, I was totally put in mind of Abe Sapien crossed with the Creature from the Black Lagoon [sidebar - in the CftBL, the Creature is after the woman - is is cause she is crunchy and tastes better or something else? In this movie, the chaser is the woman]OK - so what is this anyhow? An examination of the relationships in our lives and weighing out - what is really important. If you hang up on the ""sex"" - spoiler alert...she gets naked -you can see her bottom!you can see her top! and then....they hug]We are presented with a dichotomy in the relationships of our protagonist and those of the antagonist and how they treat and are treated by those around them.As you can tell, this can go on and on. That said, there are some scenes that are hard to take yet each moves the movie - the sandpile and the cat.One from ignorance, one from fear.Our primary characters are the woman, her antagonist [hereafter known as the stinky guy] and to a slightly lesser degree, her friends.The stinky guy, though drawn with a broad, black brush still turns in a slightly nuanced performance. In the midst of serving his masters at the cost of his soul, reading a self -help book. We are forced to ask - if he truly believed in the life he is leading, what purpose does this book serve? Are there flickerings of conscience bubbling up? But these are hints and images seen through a glass darkly.This is not a movie for everyone. It is uncomfortable in many ways and unflinching in it's depiction of events. When lesser films would have pulled back to preserve our illusions, this one does not. This film is dense and packed with allegorical imagery. It walks the line between too much and just enough. It tiptoes up to slapstick but then shines a ""and this is what actually happened"" light on the scene. Is it perfect? Hmm... it's really very very good [what I thought was the weakest scene is probably not what you thought :)].As Creature from the Black Lagoon reflected the sensitivities of the time, this film, based in OUR zeitgeist, looking back on that Golden Age reflects a different reality. Our heroine, plain though she may be, still has adult desires which are not met as most men [with one exception] can't see past her muteness to the person within. She is lonely and shares her loneliness with her neighbor who is also alien in 1962.At heart this is perhaps an exploration of different and how different fits together to form the quilt of reality. The general is different, Bob is different, the lab boss [what was his name again?] is different.Is the creature a god? Was everything that happened part of some larger design? Where did the woman come from? What is up with her scars?If you feel that a good film presents questions in an interesting way and encourages us to look for answers, you will probably like this film. If you feel that the purpose of a film to reaffirm only those aspects of life you feel are of value, you probably will not. There is enough ambiguity in key areas to let you fill in the blanks. And it is what YOU fill those blanks in with that will determine whether you like or dislike this movie.","4.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Predictable, and derivative, but pure magic - remember ""The Creature From The Black Lagoon.""","Jean","---Possible Spoilers ---Was it predictable? Yes. Is it derivative? Yes. None of that matters though because it is an enchanting fairy tale with an enchanted creature (albeit not the most handsome creature), and an enchanted ""princess."" That is what fairy tales are ... that is what we ask them to be..Visually stunning - the color green glows throughout most of the film. As a kid I absolutely loved the ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"" and if memory serves - that creature had a bit of a crush on the female lead. I mention this to remind everyone here ""freaking out"" about beastiality - we had ""Splash"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", and ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"" to name a few - nobody cried Ahhhh  ""BEASTIALITY!""Sally Hawkins delivers as usual - making us believe that she (a lovely human woman) could fall in love with a sea monster. I did not notice any of the CGI complaints some have made - it was too lovely a picture to look for all the flaws. The commentary on the times - white men ruled the earth - is just that - plain and simple. Don't believe it watch an episode of ""Mad Men."" I suggest not getting caught up in the perceived political/social implications if that is something that irritates - just watch is for what it is - a lovely fairy tale about a lonely woman, and the creature with whom she falls in love. Highly entertaining. Sally Hawkins absolutely deserved an Oscar nod for this film.","5.0 "

"The Shape of Water","Great Movie with Terrific Special Features","Tony R.","Winner of four Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director, this might be one of those movies you either love or hate. Presented as both a love story and a spin on Beauty and the Beast, this isn't for children. Rated R, it includes several scenes of full frontal female nudity. I found it to be lyrical and mesmerizing and this Blu-Ray transfer is well worth the money. The video and audio are excellent, but beyond that the special features for once actually are special, particularly if you are interested in how the movie was made. Not only are some tricks revealed but there are some interview elements with Guillermo Del Toro, the director and co-writer, that clearly reveal his passion for this project. Having previously directed Hellboy, Del Toro uses what clearly was gleaned from that film and infused those elements into this one. Color and design are used overtly and covertly so that you absorb the overall tone of the movie as part of its appeal. The special features will help you understand how these things worked and made me want to watch the movie a second time in order to see those elements employed. Of course with this package you get the additional DVD disc as well as the code to access it digitally to be played on other devices.

"The Shape of Water","Not everyone’s cup of tea, but a great film.","Richard A. Anderson","I went into this film not expecting to like it, but it just blew me away.  I’ve now watched it five times in the last two weeks.  With a lovely musical score that grows on you, one is quickly drawn in to the story of the lonely young woman and her unexpected discovery of love in a place where you would least expect it.  Her growing and unlikely attachment to the creature is built piece by piece so this improbable, implausible story actually becomes believable.  You cheer for her as she overcomes one hurdle after another in the name of love.For the haters out there, I acknowledge that this film will not be for everyone.  I think you have to approach it with an open mind and be in the right state of mind to get the most out of it.  But c’mon, calling it a porn film?  It is apparent you have never seen a real porn film.  The nudity is handled tastefully, and the “sex” scenes (at least with the creature; Strickland is another matter) are sensitively depicted.  The brief masturbation scenes are merely suggested and are intended to show Elisa as a young woman with real needs and desires.  There is quite a bit of violence also, but to me it never seemed gratuitous; it always served the purpose of advancing the plot.  So, yes, sex and violence.  The films is rated “R” after all.  I feel sorry for those who walked out on the film; you missed a wonderfully cathartic ending.Watch with preconceptions left behind, and you are in for a magnificent, though wildly unusual, love story.","5.0 "

Being mute, she must live out all the emotions she is feeling on her face, and no one alive could do it better than Sally Hawkins. This is a fairytale come true for the beauty and her beast, but they don't get to their happily ever after without going through prodigious amounts of angst.  Any good story worth its salt combines both the bitter and sweet, and this movie is no exception.  The Asset (the creature of the movie) may look like a monster, but the real monster is clothed with human flesh, loves cracking green candy between his teeth, and torturing the helpless with his many means of menace.

Perhaps the difference from some reviewers is that I enjoy reading the genre of romance and basically this is an amazing, romantic fairytale. It had all the elements I need to enjoy a great HEA. We have the sad and lonely heroine, the strong, supportive best friends (Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins), the tortured (in this case literally, tortured) hero, and the unrepentant villain. Michael Shannon made a fabulous bad guy, really embodying everything vile.

Glad, because I’d be embarrassed walking out with teary eyes, runny nose and a smile from ear to ear!! 🙄 Got it on digital video out of one click happiness. Definitely will be a collection at home!! ❤️ 💕","5.0 "
"The Shape of Water","IF YOU LIKE A GOOD ROMANCE WITH QUIRK - this will do it.","Elle Shopper Lady","SPOILER ALERT:I loved it !  But then I had a crush on Abe Sapiens in ""Hell Boy"" - so this film was satisfying my unheard call for ""more"" from the soulful sea hero.YES... I know why some had issues with it - in a few spots it DOES push one's sense of ""willing suspension of disbelief"" , the element needed for immersion in UNreality. But it was just grand to see the bad guys get it and the good guys win again and all who support the good seemed to reap at least a few ""bonus points"".  Thank you very much for this odd but triste experience.","5.0 "
"The Shape of Water","It was very different but I liked it. The ending brought tears","NC","It was very different but I liked it. The ending brought tears. I gave it four stars because I could've done without the ""porn"" scenes. Not sure why they were in the movie in the first place because they didn't help the storyline in any way. The violence in the movie kind of reminded me of Pan's Labyrinth, another very good film by Guillermo del Toro. It also had a Pan's Labyrinth vibe to it.  What I liked most about the film was the suspense and the mute character, Eliza. Sally Hawkins's acting was very convincing; she did a very good job conveying the character's emotions without actually speaking. She deserved that Oscar. Note: If you liked this movie, rent Starman. It's an oldie but goody. I think it came out in the '80s.","4.0 "
"The Shape of Water","I liked this one ... you either do or don't apparently!","E. Lynch","It appears you either love this or hate it.  No one should believe that an R rated movie would be appropriate for children -- it is not a monster movie.  Anyway, because it was graphic ... and the ""cat incident,"" I give this four stars.  Just use your imagination.  There isn't a creature like this -- he was a ""god"" and therefore not really a beast -- it is a fantasy.  I thought the acting was fantastic.  Considering the lead characters didn't speak, they managed to convey volumes!  Watch with an open mind.  The movie does bring up all the ills of people not accepting each other for whatever reason - eh ... it's not the first one to do that.  Saw it in the theater and glad I ordered a copy of it.  Fastest 2 hour 2 minute movie I went to recently.","4.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Fully deserved the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Music Score.","Jeffrey S. Dible","This is an excellent film.I have loved most of Guillermo Del Toro's movies, starting with ""The Devil's Backbone"" and the two Hellboy films. This film is closest in tone to ""Pan's Labyrinth.""  ""The Shape of Water"" is constructed like a fairy tale, with narration by Richard Jenkins's character at the beginning and end. Reduced to its essentials, it is a love story, about two beings who, standing apart, seem strange and incomplete.Pet lovers and cat lovers, be aware of a scene that occurs between 1:17:40 and 1:18:15, in which Del Toro demonstrates that the Asset / the Creature is a wild creature and needs to eat ""raw protein."" I skipped past this brief sequence when I showed the film to my wife, because Del Toro -- as in his other films -- does not pull punches when depicting violence.","5.0 "
"The Shape of Water","No pie for me . . .","Bella","While I liked the movie overall and del Toro’s work in general, over the years, I found that the depiction of straight white males, in “The Shape of Water,” to be wanting. The male lead was a caricatured sadist; another, a court eunuch pencil pusher in middle management; and the only sympathetic Caucasian characters were a Cold War Soviet spy -- of course, with a heart of gold; and a middle aged chickenhawk, leering at some young guy working at a pie shop.That said, the movie looked great; sounded great; and the gillman was beautifully brought to life by actor, Doug Jones. It is basically a stylish remake of the “Creature from The Black Lagoon” series with a serious kink, crossed with “Amelie.”","4.0 "
"The Shape of Water","A Mature Beauty and the Beast","Lenox","This was a beautiful movie. I really liked the music and the colors and tones they used in the scenes. The cast was spot on. The story was interesting, and the main character was fresh, a character we don't normally see. I rented it here when it went on sale, but I probably would have seen it in theaters if the trailer I viewed had been more representative of the film.If you leave your reviews and preconceptions at the door, keeping an open mind, you will probably enjoy the movie more than if you were going into it expecting a Hellboy prequel (as I did), or a sexual monstrosity. Yes, there are suggestive scenes with some female nudity, and yes there is a little violence and gore (about the same amount as in Pan's Labyrinth), but I found it to be just barely deserving of an R rating. Still, use your best judgement of individual maturity and tolerance level when deciding with whom you will be viewing this film.","5.0 "

"The Shape of Water","Excellent presentation of an excellent movie","K. F. Wright","Great picture quality. Generally, underwater scenes are prone to banding issues, but there were none to be seen on this disc. Even though it's a 2K upscale and not native 4K, there is a nice uptick in detail over the Blu-ray and in comparing the two, I thought the colors were slightly better on this disc as well. While not a demo showcase for HDR, I thought they kept it nice and natural, with a slight increase in highlight detail over the Blu-ray disc. The extras are pretty good and give a nice look into the production, though it does lack the usual del Toro audio commentary track that most of his movies get (he said he didn't feel the movie needed a commentary track). I'm glad I spent the extra money to get the UHD version of this movie, which was my second favorite movie of last year (coming in right behind Blade Runner 2049).","5.0 "

Yes it was a good movie *but* it did not live up to the hype it received during the academy awards ceremony.  Guillermo is a wonderful director with a very imaginative mind.  His other works like Pan's Labrynth are some of my favorite movies.  Don't get me wrong the movie is a beautiful story about the humanity (or lack thereof) in all of us so it is worth adding to your library.  I would caution you to mute your expectations a bit though.","4.0 "
"The Shape of Water","It's a fairy tale, folks.","K. Walker","It's a fairy tale. This is something that is made clear in the very beginning of the film. Are many of the characters rather a caricature/stereotype? Sure. If you're looking for something deeply meaningful you might be disappointed.  If you've been told to despise the movie and be shocked by it because ""beastiality"", I suppose you could convince yourself it's disgusting. But honestly, folks...it's a fairy tale set in semi-modern times. If you can set aside the need to find something to be offended about and simply watch it as a story - you might enjoy it.  I did, and heaven knows there's much more disappointing - and disgusting - fare released by Hollywood on a regular basis. It's a sweet story filled with the requisite heroes and villains set in the heart of the Cold War era. I gave it four stars simply because yes, I did feel it was a bit two-dimensional and predictable. Hey, the soundtrack alone is worth at least three stars.","4.0 "
"The Shape of Water","It Won Best Picture for a Reason","LR","Firstly, the representation in this film is spectacular. Moving beyond that, the plot had me on the edge of my seat the first time, the second time, and will continue to every time I watch it. The way Del Toro tells his stories is so incredible. This film is both visually stunning and extremely entertaining. On my second viewing, I noticed so many little details that make the film worth re-watching again and again. The whole production is immaculate. Also, it’s extremely funny. 10/10 would definitely recommend to everyone I know.","5.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Brilliant performance from the cast and director!","Fredy Gutierrez","This film was certainly interesting and enjoyable. *(There are possible spoilers in my review).*I really enjoyed each individual performance from the cast. In this film we get to see a brilliant  performance from Micheal Shannon (Strickland), Sally Hawkins (Eliza), Octavia Spencer (Zelda), Richard Jenkins (Giles) and of course the rest of the cast. Each actor/actress contributes in their own way and overall they make this film and story work. Micheal Shannon makes a great ""villen"" and his character development is extraordinary, we get to see the multiple sides of (Strickland) which definitely keeps the audience  entertained and engaged. Sally Hawkins delivers another great performance, I felt sympathy, happiness, and pleasure to see (Eliza) happy and alive with the (amphibian man) Doug Jones (actor). Overall, I would recommend  this film to anyone who wants to see something new-something different. This story is no ordinary story, it is different from your traditional romance story and it's certainly not a children's story. It tells a story of unconditional love, of finding love beyond a superficial level, it is about finding yourself and coming to terms with yourself. I personally see a deeper meaning to this story, but I can only interpret this brilliant work by Guillermo del Toro to a limited extent. I believe it is up to the audience to interpret this story and to express what they felt watching it. Once again, I will say it, this film just like any other film is not for everyone as everyone has a different taste for everything. However, I must emphasize that it definitely deserves a chance.","5.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Del Toro is truly a treasure!","Herbert McStinkwrinkle","ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! Guillermo Del Toro is one of the greatest minds in cinema these days. Much like his earlier masterpiece, Pan's Labyrinth and in the vein of movie like Chocolat, The Artist and Amelie, this is very much a fairy tale, but with adult elements and content in it. If you're overly conservative in your values, or want to watch it with children - don't bother. This movie is not for you. It is meant for a more mature, progressive, and open mind, and it will amaze. Five stars!","5.0 "

"The Shape of Water","Good enough to buy...","D. Meeks","I like it enough to buy it.  Stylistically, it's a beautiful film.  The acting is phenomenal, and the story is heart-rending.  It's a fairy tale, and should be approached with a certain suspension of disbelief.  It's an homage to the B movie horror flicks of the 1950's and 60's that capitalized on cold war paranoia.  I was a little disappointed that Del Toro didn't at least give a thank-you to the makers of ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon""...his amphibian man was eerily similar, but with big bush-baby eyes and all souped up with modern special effects.","5.0 "

Sally Hawkins is luminous as Elisa, Michael Shannon as Strickland gives the ""bad guy"" great depth, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins have well-developed supporting roles.  And not to forget Doug Jones, who is far and away the most attractive and sexiest ""creature"" (river god) I have ever seen.  The movie was perfect in every way, and an especially monumental achievement when you consider that the two main characters did not speak.  Guillermo Del Toro very much deserved the Academy Award for best picture and best director.  Also won for best original score, which is quite beautiful.","5.0 "

From the stage direction, to the acting, to the music score, it isn't surprising at all it won best film in 2017. A problem a lot of people have with the movie is that the main character falls in love with the creature and a lot of those people see it as a form of bestiality (technically would be teraphilia). When in reality, that's the message of the whole film. If you can manage to see past the fact that it's a (spoilers) not-exactly-100%-human falling in love with an amphibian man, then it won't be any problem. Even if that does bug you, the film still makes up for it in the direction from Del Toro. With a $19.8 Million budget, he manages to turn this movie into one of the most beautiful works of art I have ever seen.","5.0 "

"The Shape of Water","If there's a deep meaning, it's lost on me.","T. Koehler","I had somewhat high hopes given that I had heard how very ""different"" it was from most movies (usually that piques my interest) and given that it won an Oscar.  I had thought maybe it was a strange tale that would leave me with some deep underlying meaning.  Unfortunately, I thought it was just weird, and quite disjointed.  I felt that most of the movie left me just staring with a blank ""what?"" expression.I will give it credit for good cinematography and a sort of quirky, interesting ambiance.Sorry, this one was just lost on me.","2.0 "

"The Shape of Water","[portrait of love]. with a hidden mirror held up throughout the film's entirety.","elizabeth","Truly, one of the most breathtaking films I have ever had the immense pleasure of experiencing. The story, pure and poignant. The story's multitude of layered complexity of the ""truths"" & ""lies"" the characters, and all souls, must deal with and maintain in however dignified way we choose to-the ways in which truly shape us. The brilliance of the nuanced cinematic qualities, the visceral yet subtle tone of the film, consistently and beautifully constructed. For a film, it's storyline, it's characters, everything, to be so powerful and moving, with as many reviewers have pointed out already-the main characters being unable to speak-speaks volumes of the film and it's characters. Barriers shattered, and our history's (and present day's) issues with views on those that are different, be it race, gender, social/work place classes, allegiances to politics, sexuality, and people who are just simply different, or ""lacking"" in some form or another..all eloquently, sometimes quietly, addressed with green tinted mirror held up to our screens as the undertone of this film, with the poetic and nuanced stylings and mind of this director and anyone who played a creative role in this portrait of love. My new favorite love story.","5.0 "

"The Shape of Water","A Modern Romance for the Misunderstood","John Hunter McClung","The Shape of Water is the Academy Award-winner for Best Picture of 2017, but as with the previous winner, Moonlight, it is often misinterpreted despite deserving to win. Like Moonlight, The Shape of Water has been advertised in such a way that only half of the film’s merits are highlighted. The Shape of Water is indeed a science-fiction romance about a mute cleaning woman’s romance with the aquatic creature (modeled on The Creature from the Black Lagoon) housed at the Cold war-era research facility where she works. However, the film is more than a sci-fi version of Beauty and the Beast, focusing not only on the couple at the story’s center but also on the cast of supporting characters – many of whom are misunderstood. The creature himself is a Frankenstein figure of sorts, being characterized as a monster but seeking only a friend. The real monster is the villainous Strickland (perfectly played by Michael Shannon), who seeks to destroy the creature and who represents almost everything about the human capacity for evil, including racism, sexism, and a propensity for violence. Strickland is the natural enemy of almost every other character in the film. Best Actress Oscar-nominee Sally Hawkins is Elisa, who is misunderstood as a mute person. Best Supporting Actor Oscar-nominee Richard Jenkins is her friend and neighbor Giles, who is misunderstood as a gay man. Best Supporting Actress Oscar-nominee Octavia Spencer is her co-worker Zelda, who is misunderstood as an African-American woman in the early 1960s. There is also Michael Stuhlbarg as Dr. Hoffstetler, a Russian spy posing as an American, whose only real alliance is with the best interests of both science and humanity. On the surface (no pun intended), The Shape of Water might not seem like an important film worthy of winning Oscars (it won four, including Picture, Director, Original Score, and Production Design). However, the diverse cast of misunderstood characters give this film the unique quality of essentially being every common type of ‘awards picture’ all rolled into one. At the heart of the film is a mute woman’s romance with the creature who doesn’t know how she is incomplete, but the surrounding characters are also affected by this creature, who essentially represents a non-judgmental perspective of the misunderstood members of society. Therein lies the message of The Shape of Water – we as humans need to judge each other less and love each other more.","5.0 "

We were looking forward to watching this unique love story about a mute woman and a fishman. The actors and actresses chosen for this film were great, which is why it got an extra star, but it just felt like to much was being pushed in this film. For awhile it was like a fish mating with a human woman porno, and I actually had to fast forward through some of the more intense scenes. This was not as subtle a romance that the better romance films have. The romance was rushed, and I didn't feel like the two could have really fallen in love through the scenes they had together. Other ideas in this film were also pushed, the film felt rushed, and my family felt have disgusted and confused. If I could I would get my money back.","2.0 "

"The Shape of Water","THE SCI-FI FANTASY “THE SHAPE OF WATER” TAKES THE WELL-DESERVED OSCAR","RBSProds",".“A Fairy Tale For Troubled Times” - movie tagline.Four and a half FASCINATING Stars. The Oscar-winning Best Picture, “The Shape of Water”, is an extremely well-made SciFi fantasy/mystery movie by the Oscar award-winning writer, producer, and director Guillermo del Toro where the monster is not so monstrous and the humans involved run the gamut from the quietly concerned to proactive protagonists. The amount of detail by del Toro is amazing and the viewer should seek out his directorial commentary to appreciate it all. One can compare this movie to predecessors like Ron Howard’s comedic “Splash” and M. Night Shyamalan’s mysterious “Lady in the Water” and it comes out ahead of those two by being so unpredictable, with an unlikely fetching heroine in Sally Hawkins’ character and by del Toro knowing how to ‘finish’ the product with leaving it up to the viewer. And here there are unexpected shocking moments. There is only one part of the movie that is totally out of character and is probably a daydream but even that is a well-turned del Toro scene showing possibilities not realized in the beginning of the movie. Some of the nudity seemed unnecessary, except for the first and the last instances which drove home the instance of loneliness and later, discovery. Nice to see what is basically an unusual SciFi love story shockingly and satisfyingly take the best picture Oscar. Starring the fascinating Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Michael Stuhlbarg, Doug Jones, Nick Searcy, Nigel Bennett, and Octavia Spencer. Highly Recommended.

They one day capture this Merman who they plan to basically dissect. The two fall in love with each other and escape into the sea. WARNING: The movie does have the following...- female masturbation scenes- sex scenes- nudity- The idea of falling in love with a fish might seem creepy (but so is falling in love with a giant dog with horns (in Beauty and the Beast)- The woman haves an intimate scene with the Merman- There are a couple stereotypes in the film which some over sensitive people might find offensive-  Some violence and bloodIn my opinion I liked the movie, but not good enough to be worthy of winning awards. I like dark, creepy, weird, and eccentric films, but I can totally understand when I say this film is not for everyone. I read some of the negative reviews before posting this. There are a lot people who seem to be upset because the film is not for kids eyes. No kidding its clearly rated ""R"".","3.0 "

Seems she became friends with the creature way to fast.  Also, she never seemed to show fear.  I would think at least initially she would, and then move past it.

It is whimsical and childish in its magical love story between a woman and an amphibian.  It fails to make it believable with even the customer, I'm my view, lacking in realism.  It is almost the storytelling of a child, who now has the means to tell the story.In other words, or baffled my mind how this movie won awards.  The acting of the heroine is superb, she is the only believable part but then her character in undeveloped since she is mute and has the cover of her disability to allow her to be fantastic, because the range expected of a mute character is limited.Hollywood has lost character and conviction, with the loudest players dictating standards.

The plots are incredibly similar, except for a slightly different ending. But, compared to E.T., the characters are far more complex, the bad guys darker, and the action more violent. Instead of a kid vs. adult power fantasy, this pits the cleaning ladies at the lowest social stratum against the power structure. And, the friendships are much more grown-up, too.There are a few implausible moments, like a flooded room, but only a few. And c'mon, this is almost a fairy tale; it deserves a few breaks.

"The Shape of Water","Another Wonderful Film from Del Toro","Carl Schultz","Fans of science fiction, fantasy, and horror were familiar with the work of filmmaker Guillermo del Toro long before his discovery by mainstream audiences.  And for del Toro’s longtime fans, the thirteen Academy Award nominations garnered on January 23 by his most recent film, “The Shape of Water,” are neither a puzzle nor a surprise.  Rather, most of his followers wonder why it’s taken so long for the mainstream motion picture industry to discover and acknowledge the Mexican auteur.Del Toro has throughout his career alternated between Spanish language fantasy films, such as ""The Devil's Backbone"" in 2001 and Pan's Labyrinth"" in 2006, and American-made action pictures such as ""Blade II"" in 2002, the superhero film ""Hellboy"" from 2004 and its 2008 sequel.The director has additionally paid homage to the Kaiju monsters of Japanese cinema with his internationally successful ""Pacific Rim"" in 2013, and to the grand tradition of color-saturated Gothic horror with his production of ""Crimson Peak"" in 2016, while contributing substantially to Peter Jackson’s “The Hobbit” trilogy of films between 2012 to 2014, and being credited as co-author of those pictures.Considered with his close friends Alfonso Cuaron and Alejandro Gonzalez-Inarritu to be one-third of a triumvirate of prominent Mexican motion picture directors, del Toro considers the horror film genre as inherently political:  “Much like fairy tales,” del Toro has explained, “there are two facets to horror.  One is pro-institution, which is the most reprehensible type of fairy tale:  Don't wander into the woods, and always obey your parents.  The other type of fairy tale is completely anarchic and anti-establishment.""""The Shape of Water"" is plainly the second type of picture.  Inspired by “The Fisherman and His Wife,” a little-known story from the Brothers Grimm, del Toro early in his filmmaking career had hoped to make a movie about an aquatic creature who changes the life of anyone who rescues it.  But the director was never able to obtain the financing for his idea.Years later, while completing “Pacific Rim” for release, del Toro happened to be talking with a friend, author Daniel Kraus.  Kraus told the director his own idea for a film about an amphibian creature being kept in a secret government facility, and a janitor who befriends it.  Del Toro bought the idea on the spot, and began writing.Del Toro composed the script with specific actors in mind for the various parts—Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, and Michael Shannon.  The role of the amphibian was eventually played, under pounds of latex, by frequent del Toro creature-collaborator Doug Jones, with a voice supplied in part by the director himself.Set during the height of the Cold War in 1962, “The Shape of Water,” is the tale of Elisa (Hawkins), a lonely janitor who was rendered mute as a child and communicates with others using sign language.  Living near her friend and confidante (Jenkins) above a third-run Baltimore movie theater, Elisa toils with her friend (Spencer) on the maintenance staff at a top-secret government laboratory.When the laboratory quietly imports for study a creature captured from a South American river, a curious Elisa inadvertently discovers it to be a humanoid amphibian, and begins to secretly visit with it during her off-time.  Sharing her packed lunches with the creature and communicating with it through sign language, Elisa and the amphibian begin to share an intimate bond, while being stalked and tormented by a sadistic chief of security (Shannon).Combining elements from films as diverse as 1954’s “The Creature from the Black Lagoon,” Disney’s ""The Little Mermaid"" and Jean Cocteau’s 1946 French-language version of ""Beauty and the Beast,” and blending them with flourishes from a few 1940s musicals, del Toro in ""The Shape of Water"" has created a movie which builds upon the foundation of movies past, but is conversely as personal a work as Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"" in 2011.  In its own way, “The Shape of Water” becomes less a horror or fantasy picture than a celebration of the grand tradition of classic motion picture entertainment.Screened in August 2017 at the Venice International Film Festival, “The Shape of Water” earned a ten-minute standing ovation from an international audience before winning the Golden Lion Prize as the best film in the competition.  On December 01, the picture opened in just two theaters in New York City before expanding into other major metropolitan areas a week later, and increasing its release gradually as word of mouth built.  As of January 26, “The Shape of Water” was being shown in some 1854 theaters across the United States.Based upon 272 reviews, Rotten Tomatoes reports a 92% approval rating for del Toto’s picture, with the site’s critical consensus reading, “’The Shape of Water’ finds Guillermo del Toro at his visually-distinctive best, matched by an emotionally absorbing story brought to life by a stellar Sally Hawkins performance.”  Metacritic in agreement reports an average score of 86%, indicating universal acclaim.The American Film Institute has selected del Toto’s picture as one of the Top Ten Films of 2017.  And on January 23, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences revealed that “The Shape of Water” has received thirteen Academy Award nominations, a number which puts del Toro’s picture in a league with classics such as “Gone With the Wind,” “From Here to Eternity,” and “Mary Poppins.”The thirteen Academy Award nominations include nods for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay (del Toro), Best Actress (Sally Hawkins), and Best Supporting Actor (Richard Jenkins) and Actress (Octavia Spencer).With scenes depicting graphic sexuality and stomach-churning violence, “The Shape of Water” has been assigned an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, restricting viewers under the age of seventeen from attending the picture without a company of an adult or parent.  And the sardonic humor and cloying sense of camp sometimes causes the picture to teeter on the edge of becoming an explanation and defense of horror pictures to more traditional mainstream audiences.But while del Toro’s legions of fans have known for some time the reasons for the director’s successes in the peripheral horror and fantasy genres, the thirteen Academy Award nominations for “The Shape of Water” suggest that the members of the mainstream motion picture industry are finally beginning to understand the director’s appeal.On March 04, when the Academy Awards are presented, we’ll find out whether they’ll remember.","4.0 "

"The Shape of Water","The Creature from the Black Lagoon meets Beauty and the Beast...","HMS Warspite","Saw this movie in the theater and it might not be what you expect.  Think ""The Creature From the Black Lagoon"" meets 'Beauty and the Beast"", done in an art house way.  It's extremely well done, but perhaps geared to appeal primarily to an art house audience.Elisa Esposito (a fantastic Sally Hawkins) is a mute cleaning lady working in a secret government laboratory at the height of the Cold War (in a nice touch, Kennedy's Cuba speech plays in background at a tense moment).  One day, Elisa discovers the ""asset"" being held in an underground tank, a man-like amphibian captured for research purposes by Strickland, a hard-nosed government agent (great job by Michael Shannon).  Elisa will develop an odd relationship with the amphibian, and will be moved to action when the amphibian is threatened with vivisection.  She will enlist the help of her friends, including another cleaning lady, her artist next door neighbor, and a frustrated scientist with his own secret, on a desperate rescue mission.The movie has its period details down pat.  Furnishings, clothes, television and other details are spot-on, even to the handgun carried by Strickland.  It is mostly subtle about its presentation, but parts are graphic.  The ""R"" rating is a no kidding, no kids.  Go with the flow on the story, even the dance scene.  Highly recommended.","5.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Beautiful, amazing, not for the prudish. I am obsessed.","Cyph Z.","I absolutely loved this movie. Much like the director, I always had a soft spot for the old monster movie monsters. This movie is extremely detailed, and a beautiful story. I love being able to watch it multiple times and catch different nuances each time. It is just beautifully done. So far most of the people who I have spoken too who did not enjoy it were either a bit on the prudish side, or didn't 'get' it. If you love monster movies, fairy tales, sci fi, or romances (and you're okay with the love interest being a mer god) you will probably enjoy this movie. If you do not like the idea of casual masturbation references, romantic involvement with a (seriously hot) fish dude, or things that are 'weird' this is probably not for you. This is not a movie you can watch with your brain turned off. You will miss something important. And the acting is so good, it really deserves the viewers full attention. Epic.","5.0 "

"The Shape of Water","A descent movie that was ripped off","Rich Whitcomb","The Shape Of Water is a descent movie that I could only give 3 stars.  It's a romantic movie, but it doesn't seem very original or special to me.  (Just another Beauty And The Beast story)  I find it funny that Doug Jones would play Amphibian Man in this movie and Abe Sapien in Hellboy.  Amphibian Man seems like an updated version of Abe Sapien, but with a couple differences.  A couple funny things I thought of that are the same between Abe Sapien and Amphibian Man are that, Amphibian Man has two different ways of breathing, but so does Abe.  Another similar thing between the two is that, Abe loves to eat raw eggs and Amphibian Man eats hardboiled eggs.  I really do think  Guillermo del Toro stole this story, but there's no proof yet.

"The Shape of Water","the shape of love","bugman","the shape of water is just absolutely beautiful. a love story, an homage to the creature from the black lagoon, and an affecting examination of 1960's social mores in one of those crossover areas, baltimore, maryland. a showcase for powerful performances and guillermo's gorgeous eye, the shape of water was as perfect a movie for me as it gets.the relationship between elisa and the creature was built perfectly, believably, and powerfully. that they came to be so close was very believable, a hard trick to execute, especially as the central thrust of the movie--human woman gets it on with male monster--is fairly controversial, to say the least. the performers are exceptional, top to bottom. richard jenkins is his usual awesome self, playing an ageing commercial artist going through his own challenges, and realizing that they dovetail nicely with those of the creature. octavia spencer brings the humor, but also the central grounding, as a middle-age black woman in the sixties. oh creature, you think you got problems? sally hawkins is an absolute revelation as the mute elisa. acting primarily with her face and hands, she creates an emotional center to the movie that is absolutely gripping. one scene in particular, where she is making a case for the creature with sign language, was the kind of scene that makes you try to live your life better. and michael shannon is just a scene-chewing delight, as the evil and misguided government XXXXhead, who thinks the best way to divine the secrets of this incredible living being, is through torture and vivisection.the creature is a sight to behold, clearly inspired by millicent patrick's original gill-man designs, but with guillermo's clear creature influence. add an invigorating color-palette and some judiciously used cgi augmentation, and we have our modern day creature from the black lagoon. doug jones breathes life through his kinetic gills, as he, like ricou browning and ben chapman, moves with realism, and, like boris karloff, generates heartfelt empathy. it's one of the best creature performances of all-time. if it lacked anything, i would have liked to see the creature swimming more. i'm sure ricou browning thought the same thing.guillermo del toro has outdone himself, and this movie is just stunning. the music is composed and selected perfectly, and every scene is visual delight, a visual trip back to the sixties, but also back to really grande hollywood sets of the forties. it must be said that the shape of water is delightfully frank about it's sexuality, something that was both real and mature, but also essential to making this movie go. i laughed, i cried, i pumped my fist and and said ""XXXXin-A."" watching with my dad--who took me to see a showing of the original creature in 3d when i was like 5--and my brother made the whole thing perfect.","5.0 "

"The Shape of Water","Beautifully Done!","Garrison Haines-Temons","During the Cold War in 1960’s America, Elisa Esposito is a lonely, mute janitor at a top secret military base whose only true friends in the world are a fellow janitor named Zelda and a gay advertising artist named Giles. Elisa finds additional friendship in the unlikeliest place when the military captures a South American merman and keeps him in captivity for the purpose of sending him into space. The more time Elisa spends with the merman, the more she identifies with him since they both communicate in strange ways and are both outcasts in their respective worlds. Her eventual plan is to break the sea creature out of captivity before he can be tortured any further for “scientific reasons”.The fact that any movie can introduce a romantic plot to us without sounding like a shallow Harlequin romance novel is always impressive to me. As strange as it may seem, Elisa and the merman are perfect for each other. Nobody in the world understands them. Few people want to be within arm’s length of them. They may not be beautiful to the superficial population at large, but they’re beautiful to each other and that’s what true love is all about. They don’t need to argue with each other over stupid things. They don’t need to fight over pretentious jealousy. While those last two things are realistic in most relationships, they’re not found in this love story, because we all know at the end of the day such petty things are foolish anyways. Let this delightfully unique couple enjoy their moments together.On the opposite end of the love spectrum, you have a vile and disgusting villain named Colonel Richard Strickland. As the chief bad guy, he’s believable in every sense of the word. His dialogue is slick and hard-boiled without dipping into bathos territory. His obsession with defeating the Russians in the space race will lead him to do and say horrible things to get what he wants. His methods of torture are brutal even by pre-Bush Administration standards. When he psychotically breaks down, you’d better run like you’ve got rocket fuel pouring out of your butt. Although, I don’t know how much good running will do considering he’s driving around in a smug teal Cadillac. The worst part about him? He’s in a position of power and can throw it around whenever he wants. If it wasn’t for all that power, he would have been taken out long before the movie even had the chance to start.While this movie is deserving of all of its Academy Award nominations and victories, it’s not without flaws (at least for me). The opening exposition into the movie’s plot seemed a little slower than it had any right to be. The merman devouring an innocent kitty was disturbing as hell (I get that he’s a wild creature, but it knocks a few points down for him as a lover). Those two flaws may seem like small potatoes on the surface, but one series of scenes that sticks out to me is when Giles’s art is turned down by his boss and he’s banned from a pie café by the homophobic and racist owner. Before these two scenes happened, Elisa wanted to recruit Giles in breaking the merman free from the military base and he was adamantly against it. Now that Giles is friendless, only then does he want to get back in the good graces of Elisa. That’s like a high school kid who rejects his uncool friends in favor of the popular jocks, gets kicked out by said jocks, and then tries to get his uncool friends back. I know this series of scenes was necessary in Giles’s character development, but they still seemed a little suspect to me.All in all, The Shape of Water is a cinematic masterpiece that earned all of its universal acclaim. The acting was spot-on. The plot was unique. The cinematography was breathtaking. And yes, there are sex scenes in this movie that are quite lovely, but that by no means makes The Shape of Water pornographic. These scenes have a purpose in developing characters and actually get us past their surface levels. If you get a chance to see this movie, do it. You’ll have no regrets and will have to dig deep to find flaws (like I did). How does a passing grade sound to everybody here?","4.0 "

"The Shape of Water","LOVE IN THE STRANGEST PLACES","Mark Turner","I was stunned this year when they announced the winner for the best picture category at the Oscars. How could it possibly be that a movie whose description reads like a low budget horror film from the fifties could win top prize? And from a director known for movies filled with comic book heroes, monsters, ghosts and tales of fantasy? And yet it happened. Now that movie makes its way to disc.The film takes place in the early 1960s in a government run research facility. Unlike most places we’ve seen in the past this location actually employs people to do real every day jobs like clean the place up. Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is a young mute woman who works the janitorial staff alongside her friend Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer). When not working she shares an apartment over a movie theater with her advertising artist best friend Giles (Richard Jenkins).Something big is going on at the facility with the arrival of several people. First is a scientists named Dr. Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg), followed by special agent Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). The third arrival shows up in a tank, an amphibious being or fish man played wonderfully by Doug Jones. Captured in South America by Strickland the two have an adversarial disposition to one another.But Elisa sees something the others don’t in the amphibian man. She sees a kindred spirit, another person who is different from the rest and ridiculed or tortured for it. Seeing the cattle prod tipped in blood used by Strickland on the creature she decides to reach out to it instead. She shares her lunch with the creature, nothing more than hard boiled eggs, but in treating it kindly she breaks through to him.None of this is noticed by the research team. She, like several characters in the film, are ghostlike non-entities, people who are there but never seen by those they work among. The only person who witnesses her communicating with the creature is Hoffstetler. But he won’t reveal this. Why? Because he’s a Russian spy sent to gather information and possibly steal the creature if possible.The story fluctuates between the tenderness and bond that forms between Elisa and the creature, the mean spirited, bitter and cruel treatment that Strickland pushes on any and every one (including his wife) and the characters found in the periphery here. Each contributes something to the forward movement of the story. Giles is gay and shunned but the film doesn’t focus on that. Blacks are turned away from a restaurant he visits. Zelda is talked down to by her husband.Halfway through the film the decision is made to destroy the creature. Elisa and her friends set out to rescue him before that can happen. They succeed and take him to her apartment where she keeps him in the bathtub. It is here that her fondness for the creature morphs into not just affection but love as the couple become intimate with one another. It’s become one of the more controversial moments in the film but needn’t be coming off as more natural than most love scenes in films these days.But we know that the bad guy, Strickland, will eventually be pushed to become the evil government force that thinks only of killing anything they find. It’s a slow buildup to that point and when it happens in the third act you know something will change the lives of all involved before the final reel.I’ve always been a big fan of Guillermo del Toro. While I’ve missed one or two of his films, I’ve yet to see one that I thought was bad. He has a visual style all his own, one that brings the fantasy realms to the screen and makes them believable. He does that here again creating a world, a creature and a romance between species that makes sense if that’s possible. A fan of monster movies he turns the tables here making the hero the monster and the monster the hero. And it works incredibly well.The acting here by all involved is great as well. Kudos must go to Sally Hawkins for her bringing life to a character who has no way of speaking except with her hands, face and body language. She does so with skill. And while he may be ignored consistently by the Academy Doug Jones brings to life a creature that emotes through his body like no one else can. He’s done this time and time again and never gets recognized for it. Shame on those who think the only way an actor acts is through the language they project.In the end the movie may not be for everyone. There is nudity and sexual situation that mean the kids can’t sit in while you watch it. But for adults who understand the circumstances the story revolves around and who can find the romance beneath the makeup the movie is truly a film that will touch your heart.","4.0 "
"The Shape of Water","The Symbol of Unity We Never Knew We Needed","Michael J. Tresca","The poor Gill-Man (from the Creature from the Black Lagoon) gets no respect.  Unlike Universal's ""big three"" (Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, and the Werewolf), the Gill-Man is somewhere above the Invisible Man but below the Mummy in popularity.  He's so misunderstood that he was dispatched with a single shotgun blast in The Monster Squad. Well Guillermo del Toro isn't having any of that, and the Gill-Man is the better for it.The origin of the Gill-Man builds on an often-unacknowledged trope that was popularized by horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, who featured an amphibious piscine race known as Deep Ones in his short story, ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth."" Of particular importance is that the creatures desire to mate with humans, reflected white, upper-class fears of miscegenation (mixing races). In ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth,"" the horror is not just in the discovery of the Deep Ones themselves but that you could potentially BE ONE OF THEM, Deep One genes swimming in your very self and ultimately transforming you into a highly-unpleasant frog-monster.  And yes, it features a character named Gilman.The Creature from the Black Lagoon shifts the horror from a poor fishing town to the Amazon rainforest, but the tropes are largely the same: the creature takes an interest in a human female and it's up to the square-jawed American heroes to fight him off. The Gill-Man is also nigh-indestructible, as evidenced by the two sequels to the original film in which he kept showing up after supposedly being shot to death.Which brings us to The Shape of Water, a movie that inverts the very prejudices these original sources reinforced.  What if the human girl and the creature always belonged together?  Del Toro never lets us forget that the 1960s setting of Cold War paranoia and toxic masculinity shapes every interaction, between races, genders, the disabled, species, and even man's relationship with God. Del Toro makes it a point of upending everything we expect from fairy tales and monster movies.The Gill-Man has always been short-changed, a throwaway story about the monster who never gets the girl that was done better by King Kong and others.  In The Shape of Water, he finally becomes the symbol of unity we never knew we needed.","5.0 "

"The Shape of Water","Excellent movie with a message, that some don't like.","Neo","The movie itself is very good, a classic you may say. But as any other ""R"" movie you will find scenes that will make you want to close your eyes if you value more romance over sex, there is a line of thought that wants people to accept all kind of weird sex as if it was normal, this has been the case since the dawn of men, and lessons are never learned. Sex is meant to be the union and bond of male and female of the same species, there is no scientific contradiction on this statement, and that's it, everything else is a distortion of nature.Coming back to the movie, its very inspirational that love can be found in the weirdest means of relationships, same as you can love a dog as if it was your child, you may love a snake or any other pet, but in this case is a deep love that transcends the species barrier... weird, but if taken allegorically the movie wants you to understand that sometimes we build those barriers, like race, in that case race it is an actual imaginary barrier, because we are the same species and race was an invention that has been lingering for too long.","5.0 "
"The Shape of Water","This is a love letter to cinema","Amazon Customer","This is a love letter to cinema.  While there are obvious allusions and references to iconic films, it's the spirit of this piece that truly conveys the magic of classic movies.  It's an adult fairy tale giving our weary, reality-addled minds permission to suspend disbelief and to get warm and fuzzy with absurdity.  Moreover, The Shape of Water reaffirms our best notions of humanity through a non-human character.  One might say we've seen the same sort of character in ET or the Iron Giant, but this one isn't about the kids.  It's about us, the supposed ""grown ups.""  This fairy tale is rated 'R', and I think, for deliberate reason.  Guillermo del Toro has made a career of crafting myth and fable for a mature audience, but I don't think he's done it with so much heart.  In a time when everything seems so dark and apocalyptic, this film reminds us that love, connection, passion, and purpose come in strange and unexpected shapes.","5.0 "

I can't tell if most of them are literally trolls or proof that Amazon needs to enforce an IQ test before reviewing a product. Maybe most of these are in retaliation towards this movie winning Best Picture last night? Yes, the movie is Rated R for violence, Sexual situations, nudity, and language. It involves a mute woman falling in love with a fish-man creature. It's set in the 1960s when America was arguably at it's height of occurring social and racial injustices. But should you judge is simply on that? The answer should obviously be no. You should be watching this if you like to ask the question, ""what if?""Guillermo de Toro's seventh (?) theatrical release is not ashamed of showcasing the details either sets or the charisma of his cast. Like Pan's Labyrinth, GDT wants to teleport the audience to another world and ensure you there is always something to take into consideration. The sets in this movie are so well done that I had to inquire about my mother's hometown during the 1960s. Be it a double apartment, street, or Orpheum theater, GDT's crew created magnificent sets. Sally Hawkins (nominated) does a wonderful job conveying her performance even if she utters nothing. Once again, Doug Jones continues to prove that prosthetic makeup is not a dying art. Michael Shannon remains in form with another imposing role. Octavia Spencer (nominated)  is once again a treat to see on film and served her role as needed. The music, the lighting, just everything about this film serves as an example of why I go to the movies: Escapism. I do have nit picks like any normal person would, but at the end of the day, I was glad I watched this in the theater, and I cannot wait to watch again with my wife.So what if I can't watch this with my kids?

What you actually like are the movies of Jean Pierre Jeunet.  Anything in Shape of Water that you like is from Jean Pierre Jeunet.  Did you like the movie Hugo?  You actually like Jean Pierre Jeunet - the look and feel of that movie was also lifted from him.  Seriously.  Just watch some Jean Pierre Jeunet films.  Amelie.  Delicatessen.I saw a recent interview in which Guillermo Del Toro claimed he was NOT copying or paying homage to Jean Pierre Jeunet.  He excuses what he has done saying they were both influenced by Terry Gilliam.  Really?  The flooded bathroom scene EXACTLY like Delicatessen?  The tv/sitting/dancing scene, the entire look and feel of the movie... you could practically make Shape of Water OUT OF edited together scenes from various Jean Pierre Jeunet movies.  I am not joking.The only scenes you'd lack could be supplied by the movie The Space Between Us.  A woman almost identical to the lead in Shape of Water coming in from a concrete hallway with a cart of cleaning supplies to mop the floor - sometimes blood -, but also interacting just like in Shape of Water with a fish man identical in a tank identical to that in Shape of Water?  Having just seen him shamelessly rip off Jean Pierre Jeunet, do we think it unlikely he took anything from this other movie?When you strip away all that was copied, what is left?  What else was brought to the table here?  The ""bad guy"" characters are kind of cartoon/cardboard cutout style.  The fish man's character wasn't properly developed enough.  Even the female lead and her neighbor friend feel a little.... overly simple.Guillermo Del Toro makes gorgeous movies.  I certainly trusted him in the past to make good movies.  Here; he's proven he can mimic the look and general feel of another director without replicating the heart, the spirit the other director brings to the table.  What was the point of this movie?  Did someone wonder what a more shallow, more crass, less magical Jean Pierre Jeunet film would be like?In case I am not getting my point across here, let's imagine some big name musical act working for a major label making millions.  Now imagine that big name act, for their new album, picking some beloved indie band known for their unique style, sound and interesting ideas, and coming out with a new album clearly designed to copy their style and ideas shamelessly, then getting showered with Grammys for their ""unique vision""The big millionaire Hollywood fish punching the hard working indie artist with a unique vision in the gut for his lunch money.  That's what The Shape of Water is, ultimately.  Guillermo del Toro was my 2nd favorite director just behind Jean Pierre Jeunet.  Not anymore.","1.0 "

"The Shape of Water","The romantic, contemporized retelling of Revenge of the Creature (from the Black Lagoon) that won del Toro Best Picture.","John's Horror Corner","Guillermo del Toro’s heartwarming, Oscar-sweeping film depicting a relationship between a mute woman and a fish man captured in the Amazon. If that sentence doesn’t win you over, I’m not sure what will.Richard Jenkins gently narrates an overview of this unlikely love story as our senses are dazzled by surreal aquatic dreamscapes surrounding Elisa (Sally Hawkins; Godzilla, Never Let Me Go). Very kind, mute and meek, Elisa tends to her friendly neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins; The Cabin in the Woods, Let Me In, Bone Tomahawk) and works nights cleaning in a research facility with Zelda (Octavia Spencer; Halloween II, Drag Me to Hell). Their respective character dynamics are outstanding.The set design is almost drably paletted, but so enriched by aquatic blues and greens that disperse themselves across the walls and wardrobes to the lighting itself. And beautifully complementing this dark modern fairy tale is a twinkling score that spurs curiosity and fantasy. Elegant it is, but sexuality veils this tale, along with imagery of water and Elisa’s own desires. Everything remains tactful and necessary with the nudity, for example, never feeling dirty… just human, vulnerable, sensual.Our villain is Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon; Take Shelter, Bug), the man who brought the creature from the Amazon—making this something of a contemporized retelling of Revenge of the Creature (1955), which chronicles the capture, study and escape of the amphibious Creature from the Black Lagoon. But written (in part) and directed by contemporary horror visionary Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy 1-2, Pan’s Labyrinth, Crimson Peak, Pacific Rim, Mimic) and with the creature-characterizing skill of Doug Jones (Ouija: Origin of Evil, Hellboy 1-2) combining Hellboy’s (2004) Abe Sapien and The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), it is a swallowable stretch recrafting it into a love story. Speaking of which, watch out for the paralleled use of eggs and classical music to broker friendship and then wonder if this isn’t simultaneously presenting the warm-hearted Abe Sapien’s origin story.Our creature’s design is interesting, and his abilities aren’t fully explained. He’s clearly more monstrous (at least, not yet civilized or educated) than Abe, a tad more fantastic (rather than sci-fi in nature), and occasional animalistic (e.g., the cat-eating scene). We have just enough blood to feel dire, but nothing skirting the boundaries we’d expect from an R-rated creature flick. Like the nudity and sexuality, the blood and violence are executed appropriately for this genre-crossing theme.This R-rated romantic dark fantasy is nothing less than enchanting. Relationships throughout the film are flawed but oh so real, and seeing Elisa communicate with the creature is warming.The Shape of Water, Guillermo del Toro, best picture, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Abe Sapien, Doug Jones, Revenge of the Creature, origin story, Sally Hawkins,","5.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Interesting portrayal of the book...","Bambi_Unbridled","This is not the type of movie that I would normally watch, but after reading the book, I was very curious about how Deus Brânquia would be portrayed on screen.I think they did a good job on the casting. Sally Hawkins was a good Elisa, and Octavia Spencer was a great Zelda. As Zelda was one of my favorite characters, I was glad that Spencer was able to bring her to life in a way true to the book.Strickland didn't have as big an impact in the movie. None of his trek through the South American jungles was on screen, so you didn't really get an idea of how batshit crazy he became. His obsession with Elisa didn't come across as strongly as it was in the book either.Much of the story focused on the relationship between Elisa and Giles, and between Elisa and Deus Brânquia (though in the movie he was just referred to as a thing or fish man). The depiction of Deus Brânquia in the movie was... interesting. It was definitely a throwback to the Creature from the Black Lagoon. He was much more... fishy... than I thought he would be. I guess I thought him more humanoid or merman-like in my head. And yes, the fish sex made it into the movie. The nudity surprised me a bit actually, I wasn't expecting for Elisa or Laney (Strickland) to show any skin.I liked the depiction of Occam. It really drove home the aerospace research aspect of the story, as that was something that I was able to forget while reading the book.The movie did stray from the original story slightly, but not enough to bother me. However, I am really glad that I read the book first.

"The Shape of Water","Nice visuals, a bit too on the nose with the politics, couldnt enjoy it.","Robert","I had rented this the other weekend and i have a few complaints.Firstly quite a few scenes were ripped entirely from Ron Howard's SPLASH (where Tom Hanks falls in love with a Mermaid), and the play Let Me Hear You Whisper.I don't like the political message in here. its really on the face about things like Capitalism and whatnot. i was a little offended when one of the characters said ""its our god given right to cut this thing open"" obviously alluding to things like manifest destiny and other topics in American history. I like the visuals but a lot of the politics of this film (every white person being bad except for the one white communist is a bit too on the nose for me).I get the idea and yearning for a love story that transcends things like race, gender and whatnot but it falls flat with the political messages and the fact that the creature cannot even talk. With their relationship i cannot say for certain that he has unconditional love for her, for all we know, he could have been using her for his escape like what happened in Ex Machina. Even tho hes intelligent, many of her arguments and reasoning for the love to be real would be similar to what a ""Zoophile"" might say or what a ""Child Lover"" might say about their ""Love"". While i might be wrong, im bringing this up as a point of criticism.I love this director but i do not like the politics in the film. many directors, actors and celebrities have attached meaning and politics to their works as if it relates to current politics. and because of the political climate and the obvious political message of the film... i could not say i enjoyed it.if he were to have gutted out the politics of this film, it would have been much more enjoyable.","2.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Take a Piece of ""Splash"", ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" and you've found the ""Shape of Water""","PR GUY","Take a dose of ""Splash"", ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" and the imagination of Guillermo Del Toro and you have the perfect recipe for 2017's Best Picture by the Academy of Arts and Sciences.  In fact, the gold Oscar looks a whole lot like the main character in this Fantasy flick.  I wasn't sure this would be a production I would like.  The reviews were mixed and I was already siding with ""Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing Missouri"" to take home the Gold.  I call it a toss-up.  The two films have nothing in common.  Both should have shared the Oscar.  This film is definitely one-of-a-kind.  It has a little bit of everything...imagination, fantasy, romance, drama and great acting by every member of the cast...including the alien lizard thing.  LOL!  The only thing I would change is the sex stuff.  It wasn't necessary.  Not the sex between the creature and the cleaning lady, but the scene with her boss and his wife.  It just didn't fit in a film like this.  Just my opinion, though.  2017 was definitely a year that motion pictures reached new heights.  Take Three Billboards, Shape of Water, and throw in Dunkirk and Get Out.  An awesome year for filmmakers. I loved the entire quartet.  Each one could have won the Oscar.  Maybe it's time for the Academy to break down the Best Picture category into genre.  All four were winners with me!","5.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Definitely Not 2017's Best Picture","Arlo Sanchez","This movie can be summarized as ""Guillermo del Toro tried to make another Pan's Labyrinth and it failed."" I went into this film with the highest of expectations (I even cried watching the trailer just because it looked so beautiful), and I walked out so underwhelmed and disappointed. Del Toro's films have been on a decline in quality (""Crimson Peak"" was just awful), but moviegoers seem willing to eat everything up because they are aesthetically pleasing, which is what he is good at. This film has writing that sounds/feels like it's from a first timer, with a scene where a gay character finds out the man he's interested in is not only homophobic, but is also revealed to be a racist immediately after expressing his homophobia. Not to mention the scene where you genuinely feel for the main character's emotions and her feelings for the fish man, then it devolves into a song and dance number that completely ruins whatever emotion you were feeling at that very moment and leaves you dumbfounded. Also, minor spoiler here, but come on. Magical healing powers? That is the cheapest deus ex machina I think I've ever seen in a del Toro movie. And (MAJOR SPOILER) if you couldn't tell those scars on her neck were going to become gills by the end, then you have clearly not seen enough movies and shame on you for forgiving such easy and cheap writing by a mastermind of film. The performances are great, the look of the movie is gorgeous, but it truly fails to be as great as it could have been.","2.0 "

You get this train wreck. I'm all for the ""save the whales"" storyline but this movie crossed the line once we learn the main character has a SEXUAL interest in the amphibious frog/fish creature...and the thing has no visible reproductive organs so we really don't know whether it's male or female - not that we cared because sex with the thing never crossed our minds.So what's more gross than shooting pus out of putrefied fingers? The thought of sex between human and frog. So insert any creature in this scenario:  frog/fish thing, Border Collie, gorilla, boa constrictor...and you still wind up with the same perversion. The same day I made the mistake of renting this was the same day I read that a guy got 2 years in prison for ""inappropriate relations with his dog.""

"The Shape of Water","Glorified Hellboy","Riccardo Audano","I am amazed for two reasons that this movie went so far as to win an Oscar, one good , one bad :)The ""good"" reason is that inside the fantasy tale lies an exposition of the close-mindedness, prejudices, violence, racism and homophobic views that are buried deep in so much of US culture and society, religious only in the worst ways, and always ready to despise and abandon the weak. And we all know how most US people are ready to receive criticism..as shown by the fact that most of the negative reviews come from prudes ""offended"" from the scenes of masturbation or the fact that one of the characters is gay.The ""bad"" reason is that , notwithstanding the beautiful cinematography and great acting, the storyline is quite cliche' and predictable, nothing more than you would expect from the stock fantasy flick. It's basically Hellboy with the action scenes removed and substituted with romantic scenes to appeal to the female public.As of today, Pan's Labyrinth is by far the best movie Del Toro ever made, that one is really worth an Oscar.","3.0 "

I thought the water creature's appearance would be kind of vague and ethereal. Surprise! Well, I know that I could never have an intimate relationship with a merman nor a lizard. I almost quit watching the film because I thought the concept of such a thing was just plain ""stupid."" After a few chuckles I continued to watch. I chastised myself for taking things too seriously. From the apartment to the villains, everything was larger than life. The whole thing was a wild romp through fantasy which to me read like a comic book sans ink and paper. I gave the movie a four. I feel that his attempt to indulge in the sexual aspect was for ""shock"" value. There was no depth of character leading into the relationship; a little sensitivity maybe but not enough to make you feel like jumping into the sack with something with scales.  I'm a huge fan of his work, but a couple of others that he had done were a five.  This one in my opinion was not.","4.0 "
"The Shape of Water","The Shape of Nothing","DCHagy","Another year for Hollywood to kiss its own behind with this little stinker winning Best Picture.  Now, I LOVE Guillermo Del Torro, the director, but even I have to disagree with him winning Best Director.  This film is nothing more than fantasy, as most of Del Torro's films have been.  The trouble with this particular one was it was so cliched.  The acting was good across the board, but I found the story weak and contrived.  Michael Shannon expertly plays the bad guy.I am sure that most of you by now are aware of what the story is about, so I'm not going to bore you to death with a retelling!  What bothered me was I felt I'd already seen this movie.However, if parents are thinking of letting the little kiddies watch the film because it's about a love story, they need to be warned.  This film is not for children.  It contains graphic masturbation scenes, full nudity, and gore.  That is why it's rated ""R.""

Not the science fiction parts, more like the song and dance routine Elisa fantasized about with the sea creature. Not to mention how she was able to spend so much time with the creature without anyone knowing. Then of course there is the bathroom filling up with water so fast and not leaking out, and the fact most interior doors open into a room. My biggest question is, why exactly did they need the creature, and why did the Russians feel it so necessary to have it? This might have played out better with the creature being studied in a lab for it's healing abilities... instead they only ever showed it being tortured. Didn't make much sense to me. Even the music was sort of a rip off from HUGO. However, the actors were excellent and totally committed to their roles. Also, I thought the time period was played out very well.

"The Shape of Water","If It Were a Hallmark Movie...","Neb42","If The Shape of Water appeared on the Hallmark or Lifetime channels I’d say it is better than most of the films that appear there.  But, an Academy Award winner, best Movie of 2018?  No way!  It’s never really clear what it is about the creature that makes him so irristible to Elisa.  He’s a good swimmer, presumably, and the two of them have a shared interest in hard boiled eggs.  And then there’s those gill like openings on Elisa’s neck, but that’s about it.  The over the top evil Colonel as played by Michael Shannon, doesn’t add anything.  He’s more like a comic book villain with no perceivable reason for hating the creature as much as he does.  Maybe he confused it with The Creature from the Black Lagoon.  Just a so-so movie, at best.  I think a lot  of one star ratings come from people who paid money to see this movie expecting something special, which it isn’t.  You do, however, get to see Sally Hawkins “abusing” herself in a bath tub, if that’s your thing.","3.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Thin and Superficial","mr. contrarian","There just wasn't enough here content wise to satisfy me despite outstanding performances.  I could never suspend my immediate disbelief that a unique creature like this wouldn't be studied more systematically, that such a sadist would be allowed to harm it, and such a low level maid would be left unattended around it.  My intelligence was insulted almost every minute.  I'm surprised the left wasn't outraged that a pretty young British actress would be allowed to portray a supposedly repulsive Mexican woman.  I understand the implications that blind ambition is bad and caring for your fellow creature is good, but the audience is hit over the head with this simplistic message again and again.  Finally, for a film which seeks to make fun of cold war paranoia, it cuts the legs out of it's own argument by putting actual Russian spies around every corner.  In short, it's all absolute nonsense with actors who deserved a more nuanced script.","2.0 "
"The Shape of Water","The love scenes with our little water monster are INCREDIBLY tame ...","Gegaroth","First off - this film is rated R for a reason. There is violence, sexual content, nudity, etc. It's aptly rated for the content so I'm not sure why others are upset about it. The rating presents a fair warning to the viewer. This is not a children's monster film.For those screaming ""bestiality"" - time to chill. Beauty and the Beast may as well be categorized as bestiality too, by that definition. He technically isn't an animal, but an anthropomorphic water-god.The love scenes with our little water monster are INCREDIBLY tame in comparison to what you'll see on TV. Seen Game of Thrones? It's way more graphic than what you'll see in this movie by a streeeeetch.Story-wise, I enjoyed it. The characters are interesting. I've read other reviews saying it's pushing some sort of an agenda - it's not. The main character is disabled, there's one whole gay character, and a supporting character is of color. I don't think there's an ""agenda"" to push here except showing the difficulties these demographics would face during the decade the movie is based in (circa the Cold War) and are only briefly mentioned. Del Toro's directive style is evident.The story was cute. The main characters were endearing. Was it perfect? No. Was it a movie I thought was worth watching? Absolutely.","4.0 "

ALL of the actors did amazing work in this film. It isn't a fast paced action film, but it was not in the least slow. The plot kept moving and while I find some of the story dark and disturbing, overall it had a beautiful ""deep"" quality to it that befits ""the deep"" otherwise known as subconscious, or water...  This movie is a love story, unusual only in the characters that fall in love, but I didn't see the ""creature"" as anything other than human, just another species of human. And if we were adapted to live in water, we might look something like this as well. There are ocean creatures known to be able to regenerate themselves, which falls in with this story..

I think they had to make it a period piece in order to allow Michael Shannon's ""white Christian man's"" chauvinism, bigotry and brutality to run amuck in a more blatant manner. As for the fishman - let's face it - all praise aside, it is 90% The Creature from the Black Lagoon, and the story arc is an almost perfect sequel to that film - fishman captured somewhere in the wild and brought back to be studied and exploited before it gets the girl and escapes.","4.0 "

I've always been a sucker for these types of stories myself, but even from an unbiased standpoint I feel that the movie was both a visual wonder and amazing in terms of cinematography and directing.The main draw of this movie is of course the romantic aspect of it, and I personally found the romance to be adorable and yet also beautiful. I typically don't enjoy romance movies at all, but I found myself engaged and actually wanting Eliza and the Asset to have their happy ending. I was in tears at the end simply due to how invested I was.The fact that neither the main character nor her amphibian lover could speak and instead used sign language to communicate was such a fascinating artistic choice in my opinion. I love how this was used to establish their bond and their worth to each other and was the basis for their relationship working.A fair warning to those who don't know however: There are some sex scenes and depictions of violence that might really rub you the wrong way. If you don't think that you can handle the idea of a woman and a monster in a sexual relationship, then you should probably skip over this one. For everyone else though I highly recommend at least checking the movie out and being open-minded to it.

Some comments have lead me to believe who viewed this film may have missed the endearing tale by clinging to ideals considered to be the ""norm"".  Film, like all art, is evolving.  Those that felt uncomfortable with the nudity and inaccurately portrayed this film as pornographic: please remember that while nudity may not make this a family-night movie for kids 10 and under, it was never meant to be a children's film.  Any adult who has ever loved or been loved, has likely seen the human body in it's entirety and as an adult should be able to distinguish the terms pornographic and nude as entirely separate. Also, this is not Beauty and the Beast. Excellent film, however, not the same film. To say that would be an unfair generalization in terms of storyline. This is not a film that everyone will enjoy.

"The Shape of Water","extraordinary, moving and very beautiful","poodleskirt","I watched this film last night, and I'm still thinking about it.  I won't rehash the plot - plenty of reviews have already done that. I'm thinking out loud about the film and how it made me feel.  I think this is the point of the film: it's not what you think about it, it's what you feel about it.  A lot of reviewers have commented on the political agenda in the film, and it is certainly there and so obvious that there is no way to miss it.  That said, it didn't bother me, and I usually hate that kind of thing, because the central story itself casts such a spell that the peripheral stories really don't matter much.  This is an adult fairy tale and a highly sexual one - definitely not for the children.  Neither of the main characters speak with words, but they speak nonetheless and the love that blooms between them is surprisingly moving.  The main human character, Eliza, cannot speak and she lives a fairly lonely life though she has two good friends.  The ""asset"", as the sea man is called, has a largely unknown past.  It is asked in the film about ""the asset"" if he has always been alone.  That is a theme of this film - being alone and forming connections.  I thought as I watched the film and the love story develop that there were only three possible ways for this film to end and none of them could be completely satisfying, because, no matter what happened, someone was going to end up alone.  It is one of the ironies of the film that all three of the possible endings actually happen and within just a few minutes.  The ultimate ending feels right but, like the film itself, there will be suffering and loss.  Fairy tales often have a tragic overtones and this one is no exception.A number of viewers noted that the film included scenes of bestiality.  I don't agree.  Though sexual contact between characters occurs, ""the asset"" is no dumb beast.  He is intelligent, responsive to love and is loving himself. Though there is wildness in him, he clearly is not a wild animal and indeed possesses powers which he uses intelligently and not instinctively.  On a technical note: the creature is actually quite beautiful and whoever created this design did a wonderful job.  The music in the film is also outstanding.  It doesn't create the mood of the film but it helps support it.  SPOILER:  Finally, the movie makes much of the fact that Eliza could not speak and that she had scars on her neck from the accident that made her mute.  I may be imagining this, but I seem to recall that the scars are unusual in some way.  As I've thought about the movie this occurred to me.  Eliza and ""the asset"" grow close very quickly and since this is a fairy tale, I wondered if in some way she had always been meant for him, that their mutual destinies had always been meant to intertwine, perhaps from a much earlier date, but something intervened.  I wondered if her scars might have been meant to be gills and if she always was meant to belong to the waterI thought the film was beautiful and emotional on a very deep level, at least it was for me.  Everything about it is perfect. It is not a movie for everyone, but it is a remarkable achievement.","5.0 "

"The Shape of Water","My Perspective as a middle age Gay Man: A Bunch of Identity Politics ClapTrap Disguised As a Movie","michael moodgroove","Time for my Hollywood Minute for anyone who saw Shape of Water. I consider myself liberal, but maybe I'm not, because this was my sincere reaction to The Shape of Water. Spoilers ahead.That movie was one of the most liberal, over-sentimental, pretentious pieces of claptrap I've seen in a long time. Del Toro puts so much energy into an over-designed ""realistic"" portrayal of the time period, that his movies have become increasingly artificial. He's a long way from The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth. His movies look more and more like Tim Burton movies everyday.The ""inclusive"" conceits of this movie are so overbearing it's laughable.What does diversity and inclusion mean in 2017? It's not enough to make a generalized thematic plea to love and tolerance and have a racially diverse cast - No, to drive home it's politically correct agenda, the movie is concerned with a never ending series of sanctimonious portrayals tailored for interest groups and liberal hot topics. Our female lead in the Shape of Water not only has to teach us about tolerance and love by dating a fishman, the character also has to be MUTE, so we can also include the disabled. Not only is she MUTE, but also hispanic. Not only is she a fish kissing, mute hispanic, but the reason she is mute, is she was possibly cut in a violent sexual assault to stop her from screaming when she was a youth. #MeToo.Not only is Elisa Esposito a Trout Stroking, mute hispanic, possible rape victim, but also an ORPHAN. #HardknockLife This gal has it tougher than ANNIE. Because not only is she a scarred, mute, hispanic, assaulted orphan, but unlike Annie, she really did grow up to be a CLEANING LADY. She' supposed to be poor, yet today her incredibly spacious apartment with gigantic windows over a movie theater no less #RomanticPoverty, would probably rent for $3,000 a month in NY now! In case all of Elisa's liberal box checking weren't enough to sell the movie's messages, her best friends are the righteous Octavia Spencer #OscarsSoWhite and her middle aged, queer neighbor Giles #GLAADawards, who sometimes acts as a father figure to Elisa #GayParentsIt's not enough that Giles be an old gay man living under the repression of the 50s to sell its point, he is also an ARTIST #OfCourse, because not only does the audience need gay representation in the movie, it's important they know he is talented and sensitive too. And of course Giles lost his job because he's gay, but when he IS working, he's forced to paint pictures of smiling, HeteroNormative families eating Jell-O. Oh, the Horror!When Giles pursues ""The Pie Man"" by endlessly going to the local diner (buying dozens of pie slices), the white, straight, pie guy rejects him very publicly. But in case the audience might be confused and think that the pie man is the victim of a lecherous old nancy pursuing someone half is age, touching him without permission and kind of stalking him, #NotMeToo #DoubleStandard, Del Toro includes a black couple entering the diner directly after, who are refused service and get chased away. Not only is the seemingly clean cut, all-american pie man revealed to be HOMOPHOBIC, but also a huge RACIST to boot. Del Toro really wants us to know how bad that guy really is!Why is the Gay Giles subplot important to the movie? Because he's there to teach us that LOVE is LOVE.But that's a funny thing, because a few years back Rick Santorum was (rightly) raked over the coals when he ridiculously compared homosexuality with bestiality saying it was all a slippery slope. Guess who just did the same thing? Del Toro. In this movie, the attraction and love a gay man has for other men is inferred to be the equivalent to a woman who wants to marry a fish monster from a lagoon; just the way Rick Santorum implied that homosexuality is the same thing as a man wanting to have sex with a horse! The only difference is that Santorum didn't make a $20 million dollar movie that says just that!Who is the Villain? Well, it's not enough that Michael Shannon be the embodiment of a corrupt, militarized government who wants to vivisect the fishman; he beats it with a cattle prod. He's also a racist. And an ableist - unless it's a mute girl - in which case he's also a predatory boss, because Del Toro let's us know that Shannon likes his bitches quiet when he screws them! That's how PRIVILEGED he is. He's so selfish in bed his wife can't even make a noise and cleaning ladies have to mop up his piss at work when he leaves the bathroom. Again, just in case we are confused about how AWFUL Michael Shannon is with his abuse of power, race, the disabled, fish people, underlings and innocent floor moppers - he demonstrates that he loves his car more than his family; embraces consumerism, capitalism, and the flag;  is an unashamed career climber;  has the potential to be a rapist or at least be a cheating philanderer;  makes multiple statements regarding his belief that america is great, and is an unrepentant, christian patriot. If that is too abstract for you, well then Shannon's finger is also rotting off!And the Creature? Here's some ambition. He's a metaphor for the mute and disabled, immigrants, gay people, racism, environmental plundering, cruelty to animals, species extinction, government sanctioned torture, Guantanomo Bay, scientific and medical malpractice and on and on. That's a lot of abuse to heap on the gills of a single amphibian. He might as well be JESUS. Oh wait...HE IS!In a FINAL detail of puppet mastery for susceptible liberal minds, we know the Fish Creature represents ultimate GOOD, because it is revealed at the end that not only can he HEAL like Jesus, but also could be a GOD!So now we are all educated: God approves of poor hispanic and black cleaning women, people with disabilities, homosexuals and even sensitive foreign scientists - But hates husbands, straight white men, the government, and a car-loving, hard working patriot like Michael Shannon! And what a more perfect mate for Fish-Jesus than poor, mute, VIRGINAL, Elisa who's so pure and clean she's only ever masturbated in her own bathtub! We even learn the lesson that Hollywood is the great humanizer, because Elisa loves the movies, and when the fishman briefly escapes where else would we find him but intently studying a flickering movie screen.As someone who grew up on the creature From the Black Lagoon, I have no problem with Del Toro subverting the formula.I get it. Man is the real monster. The silenced and neglected are the HEROS. The romantic white adventures of yesteryear are the pillagers. But I haven't seen a movie put down so many layers of self-righteous stereotypes so THICK. This movie is as paranoid and delusional a fantasy as any one of those conservative cautionary movies from the 50s like ""Reefer Madness."" It's that silly. All that was missing was someone in a hijab. No wonder Hollywood and critics ate it up. At least Splash from the 80s didn't have any of these pretensions.When the TroutMan and Elisa's ugly, half person/fish head, demigod, immigrant children start crawling up on the shores of america to take over, people will be upset that a steely-eyed, america focused patriot, like Michael Shannon's character isn't there to give them the fishhook!","2.0 "
"The Shape of Water","This had so much potential but was ruined.","Beaudette Family","As the title states, this had amazing potential and while I despise leaving negative reviews, I am attempting to save some people money and the sanity of innocent people who may try to watch this disaster. For the love of all that is, do NOT let your kids watch this thinking it is just a dark disney story. It's not. There is gore, cursing, nudity, blatantly stupid sex scenes and most of it is not integral to the story or the plot. Much of the trash is just for shock factor or to appeal to young males, who do not know any better. Someone called this soft porn and it actually is, just that. There is a 10% romance factor.""Romantic fever Dream?"" More like drug induced... what in the world was Guillermo on when writing this story?!I am not referring to the darkness of the story or the fact this has to do with an inter species relationship. This has to do with the story telling, the constant bombardment of bad, lewd, disgusting sex scenes and innuendo. We are not talking romance, but straight up garbage where there could have been good story. Instead we are given clips of shows from before the 60's, which is when this movie was supposedly time based and yet it felt of the 1950's atomic era more than cold war 60's.CONS:1. Unnecessary and constant clip shot nude scenes of the main female character. Soooo not needed. How much did they pay her to embarrass herself like this? There was no reason for such scenes, not even to show you that she and the sea being were having sex.2. Bath scene blurred of her masturbating. ( I am actually still sickened by that scene short as it was and fast forwarded as soon as I realized what crap was playing.3. Vulgar sexual innuendo from more than a few male characters. ( Again, unnecessary and trashy and by vulgar I honestly mean that.)4. Yes, there is a very bizarre, out of nowhere, dance scene with the mystical sea creature being, that I am sure she was imagining. I could not watch it for the sake of my own sanity. Fast forward.5. Constant political views that we should all be sick of seeing by now. Del Toro manages to use the side characters lives as a way to wave his flag pole about, on what he personal believes in and is about. I wanted to watch a romance, not his view points on the world. Is this a foreshadowing of what is to be seen in the new video game he is involved with, Death Stranding? I would have to think so. Don't buy that either.The good part would be the acting. These actors could actually express seriousness, despite the pathetic attempt at a romance story. By the way, the romance that builds between the sea being and the female character is lacking beyond words.This left the actual relationship between the two main characters to flounder and be rushed with clip scenes of egg eating and record playing. In a word, unbelievable that this romance bloomed at all, because you do not see it happen. All  you get to see is Del Toro's political leanings through character stories of other people.What happened to a good movie with a magical romantic storyline? The shape of water had amazing potential to be reminiscent of beauty and the beast, even with it's dark scenery and odd story line. Instead Del Toro delivers junk that somehow won an award. I paid money for this thing, yes, real money and was left feeling sick for part of the movie and empty for the rest, because I felt nothing for the couple for most of the movie. They had no basis for a relationship, as the story did not 'build' that for them.The glowing reviews for this must be paid for by the studio or people who were completely intoxicated while watching.The only good part of the movie was the ending. So if you dare to buy, dare to rent it, which ever you choose, just skip to that final scene of around five minutes. That is the only time I felt anything romantic between this supposed couple. What a depressing loss of what could have been a great romance, something to remember for all time, but was turned inside out for shock factor and 1960's pinwheeling, spirals of shock and pointless nudity, vulgar language and political hee hawing!Honestly, if you are looking for a good, twisted, dark romance, find an old movie called Blood and Donuts. While not perfect, it beats this one out of the water and it has it's own problems that left it lacking, but... I would watch it a hundred times, over this one.End of story: 2 stars because the ending actually mattered. The rest is ... yeah...","2.0 "
"The Shape of Water","A tale of intrique, rising above the patriarchy, and finding love in unexpected places","KarToon12","Guillermo del Toro, to me, seems to be an example of the ""starving artist"". He's a director who's always dared to make movies that are truly unique and different, especially on an artistic and visual scale--telling stories with weird and/or unconventional characters, and his films have won the hearts of many gothic, horror, and fantasy fans. Unfortunately, Hollywood at large seems to always brush aside his films and/or only give them a passing glance in favor of ""popcorn flicks"" and ""Oscar bait"" movies. Only in recent years has the big screen moguls been sitting up and taking notice of the man's passion projects, and it's for good reason, for hopefully this film will give del Toro the recognition he long deserves.Taking place sometime during the 1960's, the film tells the story of Elisa--a mute woman who works as a janitor at a secret government laboratory in Baltimore. Her only two friends are her next door neighbor, Giles, a struggling (and closeted gay) advertisement illustrator, and her co-worker, Zelda, an African-American woman who also serves as her interpreter at work. One fateful night, the facility receives a creature who was captured from a river in South America---a humanoid, amphibian ""gill man"". Elisa almost instantly forms a bond with the creature, and does her best to keep him comfortable in the prison fish tank. And upon discovering her superior's plans to experiment on and exploit the creature, she mounts a risky escape. With the help of her friends and an unlikely ally in the laboratory, will Elisa be able to free the gill man....and possibly have a ""happily ever after"" with him?On the surface, the plot may sound like other fantasy tales we've heard before, from ""Creature of the Black Lagoon"" (which the gill man seems to borrow heavily off of in terms of design), to ""Beauty and the Beast"", to the old ""monster is actually innocent and friendly, and heartless G-Men want to torture it"" routine.  But that's not to say the story isn't entertaining and suspenseful--far from it. There may be nothing new under the sun, but an old concept can be made fresh again, and it all lies in presentation. The art direction and set pieces are beyond lovely---instantly transporting the viewer back to a bygone era that may have seemed innocent and sweet on the outside, but had an underlying darkness that people with thick nostalgia glasses tend to ignore, such as rampant bigotry and fear of the unknown.This point is driven all the more home by the film's strongest aspect---it's choice of heroes. It's rare to find a film with a disabled person as the main lead, and though Elisa can't make a sound, she finds her own ways to speak out against injustice, both for the gill man, and for her friends, and her bravery sparks both Giles and Zelda to face their bullies and/or find inspiration to get out of the rut they've found themselves in. (Which, on a similar note, kudos to the filmmakers for the added symbolism of a mute lady being aided by a gay man and a black woman--two people who, back in the 60s, were never given a ""voice"". )  Even one of the scientists (who isn't all that he appears) is partially won over by Elisa's compassion. Her love for the creature is more pure, real, and honest than any of the romances of her fellow humans, arguably, and though the gill man isn't a perfect angel (he understandably attacks his captors and eats Giles' cat at one point), he's the only one who's ever loved her fully and completely---not seeing her for anything she lacks, but rather viewing her as a whole person. And though the gill man is also silent, his mannerisms more than make up for it, making him easy enough to understand, especially the lengths he'll go to to protect the woman he's fallen in love with.Both artistic and unique, with clever symbolism and a heartfelt love story,  this tale about a ""monster"", oddly enough, has easily become one of my favorite romantic stories, and it's nomination for best picture at the Oscars is well deserved. Here's hoping that del Toro's future films are just as successful, and that more off-beat films like this are given their just due by Hollywood.","5.0 "
"The Shape of Water","'The Shape of Water' - A Fairy Tale for Troubled Times. My Review + Personal Thoughts of the Film","Christina","Guillermo del Toro's new film 'The Shape of Water' is a film that will envelope you with its love, filling up all the spaces in your heart like water in a glass. This is a film he's wanted to make for the longest time during his career as a director and it shows. Guillermo has been fascinated with monsters since childhood, so much so that he sympathizes with them on a personal level.As a child, he watched 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' one Sunday morning and was marveled at the Gillman. He even rooted for it to win the damsel, but was naturally disappointed with the ending. Since then, he has made fantastic monster movies, such as: 'The Devil's Backbone', the wonderful horror-fairy tale 'Pan's Labyrinth', 'Mimic', 'Hellboy', 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army', 'Mama', 'Crimson Peak', 'Pacific Rim' and now 'The Shape of Water'.This movie takes place during 1962 in Baltimore, during the Cold War and the race to space with Russia is on. Our beautiful heroin Elisa (played by Sally Hawkins) is a mute, who works as a janitor in a high-security government research facility at night. Then one day, an Asset (played by Doug Jones) is brought in from the Amazons by Richard Strickland (played by Michael Shannon) and her life changes forever. Elisa develops a bond with the Asset, which is a humanoid fish-man. Neither of them can communicate verbally, but they speak through sign language. Their bond steadily grows into something beautiful as both characters find that they are kindred spirits; the world may not understand them, but they understand each other. That's the beauty of their love.Other characters in this movie are: Zelda Fuller (played by Octavia Spencer) who is Elisa's coworker and headstrong friend, Giles (played by Richard Jenkins) who is Elisa's neighbor and dearest friend, and finally Robert Hoffstetler (played by Michael Stuhlbarg) who is one of the scientists in the research facility with a double life and also sees the beauty of the Asset.Almost every character matters in 'The Shape of Water', whether you like them or hate them, they're remembered in some way.I wanted to see this movie since I stumbled upon the trailer by accident online. I love monsters, so a film telling a love story between a woman and a fish-man was right up my ally. I saw the film the day it came to theaters and I loved it. 'The Shape of Water' was everything I hoped for and more. And I am VERY happy this film won Best Picture.DISCLAIMER: THIS MOVIE IS RATED R FOR A REASONThis movie does have a hefty amount of violence. There is swearing, sex, blood and gore, and a cute little kitty gets eaten alive. DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE EASILY UPSET BY THOSE THINGS. PLEASE. SENSITIVE PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE IT EVEN THOUGH IT'S CLEARLY RATED R, AND THIS IS THE ONLY MOVIE I'VE SEEN THAT WELL DESERVES ITS RATING SO BE AWARE OF WHY.DISCLAIMER II: THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE (SOME SPOILERS)Aside from the surprising amount of violence and the eating of an adorable kitty cat, this is not the kind of movie for everyone and that's okay. The people who I've seen adore this movie are Del Toro fans and monster movie fans. Some people didn't like this movie for quite a few reasons.One reason is because Elisa and the Asset make love - even though it's never actually seen but it is heavily implied - and I can totally understand why. The idea of a woman having sex with a fish-man is very uncomfortable for some people - and if you are this type of person, then this movie will make you uncomfortable in some areas. But I say if you're aware of what you're getting into and you have an open mind to new things, then I suggest you dig into the content of the film before watching it, that way you can at least form an opinion based on what you watched.Another reason people did not like this movie is because this movie supposedly has a kind of left-leaning ideal. And this argument makes me mad when used from both sides of the political spectrum. To be clear, I am not liberal at all, nor am I conservative. Sometimes I don't agree with Del Toro politically but I didn't let that ruin my experience with this film.I HATE that liberals are using this movie to make people who they feel are ""conformists"" and that they shouldn't relate to the characters or that they will never truly understand the story since it involves a main character that is a disabled female, the racist attitudes towards Zelda and the homophobia towards Giles.No, you do not have to fit into any categories to enjoy this movie. It's not about the ability, the race or the sexuality of the characters that matter - it's what you relate to them on a personal level.Del Toro wanted to show people the beauty of the 'other'. This is a film to show the people who are different are just as important. I, as a tomboy who grew up around kids that didn't understand me, could relate to this film. It's a movie about love during troubled times - and with how ridiculous people can be, it was refreshing seeing a movie talking about accepting people for who they are.Please, go into this movie with an open mind. Don't let anything tarnish your experience with it. Form your own opinion based on what you watched. If you love this movie: amazing.If you only like it: awesome.If you end up not liking the movie: That's fine as well.At least say you watched the movie and formed your own opinion on it. It's worth the watch.","5.0 "

"The Shape of Water","An unusual exploration of what it means to be human","Observer","I loved this movie because it is an offbeat blend of the monster and romance genres.Set in the early 1960s, Elisa, the main character, is isolated and lonely until she meets the creature referred to as ""The Asset,"" an amphibious humanoid captured in the Amazon.  We watch their bonding over time and the Asset's abuse by Strickland, his keeper.  Learning the Asset will be killed, Elisa risks everything to save him.  In between the Asset's rescue and release, Elisa and he become emotionally and physically intimate.  It's a great story of discovering the humanity, and the lack of same, in others told with sensitivity and humor.Pay attention - you may be surprised at the monster's identity.Rated R for nudity and implied sex.","5.0 "

"The Shape of Water","Some Good Some Bad","WayNorth","This movie was a mixed bag for me.  I really liked the cinematography, the mood, the setting, the visuals, and the actors were all very good.  The musical soundtrack was very well done and really added to the ambience of the film.  Just basic scenes of them doing laundry really came alive with the sounds of the period.  Amphibian man could have had more expressive eyes, they were a little too fish-like for me. I think it will look dated in a very short time.  The violence was not necessary, as usual.  If just a few scenes were edited or omitted, I actually think this could have been a good family movie.  It has a happy ending. Its message is really about love and acceptance of differences in people.  A major off point for me is when amphibian man eats the cat. I almost turned it off.  Totally unnecessary and it undermined the intelligence and compassion of the character.  I think if someone of normal intelligence was in a foreign land, that they would ask their hosts what the appropriate food choices would be.  You wouldn't just start eating whatever in an unknown environment, plant or animal.  That scene made the character seem like a simple animal which made it harder to swallow their love affair.  Wish there was more of his personality showcased instead.  FWI, if you are sensitive or have PTSD, I recommend waiting to watch this on the platform VidAngel (you can link it with an amazon account.)  It provides very specific filtering options, and is a god-send in a time when almost all movies contain unnecessary violence (I do not work for them.)","3.0 "

The Shape of Water is a dark and brooding tale of good and evil, love and hate. A pure, kind lady meets a sad, trapped creature who touches her heart. They share kinship and eventually love. There is nudity, and insinuated sex acts- nothing new if you've been to the movies in the last decade. There are well developed supporting characters who give great performances.

For instance, you have to be okay with cursing and nudity and a woman embracing her sexuality, even if no one is there (didn't think those things would fall under open-mindedness, but I guess so). However, more importantly, you have to be able to recognize that this film is not going to look like the traditional box office action-adventure movie.

It's rated R...Did you think it was going to be a throwback to the movies from the 1950s from your childhood?  No...if you wanted to see films like that, watch b-rated scifi movies.  There are a *ton* of movies like that out there.Yes, there was nudity.  Yes, there was sex, including a rather disgusting scene between the antagonist and his wife, which really emphasized how poorly the classical american family treated the wife/mother of the family.  Yes, there was female masturbation.  If you considered the creature to be a beast, then yes there was ""bestiality,"" (no, you don't see the main characters getting it on, the scene cuts out before that) but if you thought of him as an intelligent creature (kind of the point), then it was just sex with a non-human intelligent being. Didn't Kirk get it on with tons of Orion Slave girls? Why the f- are you focused on this?  They didn't even show them getting it on.Regarding the film itself, it was alright.  The music was good. The cinematics were good.  Funny at parts, not funny at others. There was an interesting dance number which came out of nowhere.  It was, overall, very whimsical.

It is a suspenseful love story about how those who are lonely, disenfranchised, and often invisible in this world find meaningful connection and love while also discovering what makes humanity great - altruism. The sex scenes are tastefully implied with nothing beyond an embrace shown with focus more on the emotional intimacy growing between the characters. I love how this movie gave a voice to those that are usually absent in movies (i.e, normal looking everyday working class women, low SES, people of color, disabled, or gay) and would have been particularly invisible during the time period the movie is set in.

"The Shape of Water","A Woman with a Voice!","Tom M. Saunders, Ph.D.","The Shape of Watera review Even when blindness came late in life at 90, Lillian’s mouth would not be silenced.  ‘Women who have demanded rights have always had rights, or died winning them.’ Elisa Esposito (abandoned one) and Lillian would have become fast friends, and, together, been invincible!  Elisa, much like baby Moses, was abandoned in the water, and left to die with deep scars on either side of her throat -- and her soul.  Adjusting to her tragic beginnings by living a predictable, metronomic life, orchestrated with an egg timer, Elisa allows herself one luxury in lieu of Love ⎯ collecting and wearing high-end shoes! Set in the early sixties, Baltimore, Maryland, Water, symbolic of Love, always takes the shape of its container.  Sally Hawkins, as the mute heroine, Elisa, still leaves no part of her character without expression.  Even when her looks of contempt totally deliver a message of angry defiance, she still signs the F-bomb to her Evil-personified boss in the middle of an accusatory interview.  Elisa is flanked by Zelda (Octavia Spencer) who has been her best friend for ten years.  They are veteran custodians, and are equally yoked for seizing power when the situation demands ⎯ each demanding to be heard, even when mute!  This time, the Angel wears Prada!At first glance, many have believed that the advertised “monster” was the amphibious creature.  Not!  As one local community church posted on its billboard last Easter, “In the End, the Lamb Wins!”Shape is a photographic essay of the classic struggle between Love and Evil ⎯ an adult fairy tale commencing where Beauty and the Beast ends.  If your choices usually select neat and tidy plots that are easy to understand, Shape is not for you.  This film deserves at least three viewings ⎯ especially if you are holding your breath through the first two.Tom M. SaundersJanuary 11, 2018","5.0 "

"The Shape of Water","Mishmash of Water","Sesho","I've never been a big fan of Guillermo Del Toro, but if I had to say which of his films I've enjoyed most, those would be Pan's Labyrinth and The Devil's Backbone. Blade 2 was good, at least back in the day. The only one of his films I HAVEN'T seen is his first, Cronos. So keep that in mind when I say negative and positive things about The Shape of Water. I've gotten the impression online that if you didn't like this film it's because you're dumb or you just don't get Del Toro or that it's just backlash now that he's ""mainstream"". So what I'm going to write is from the perspective of someone that has seen 90% of his work.The Shape of Water, or, as one of my friends affectionately called it, ""Grinding Nemo"", is about a lonely middle aged woman named Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) that works as a custodian in a secret military facility in America during the early 1960s. There she meets and falls in love with The Creature From the Black Lagoon.The monster is being treated pretty hideously by Bill Hader (aka Michael Shannon) with a cattle prod in what is another in a long line of evil military dudes that want to use the creature's physiology to make stronger soldiers. He has no sympathy for the creature and sees it as an animal. It probably didn't help that the monster bit off two of his fingers.What happens over the course of the movie is that Elisa and the monster bond and fall in love and Elisa has to figure out how she can free him (?) from the clutches of the evil American military. One of the subplots is that the Russians are also trying to get their hands on the monster as well.The first thing I thought as I started watching the movie was how much it looked and sounded like the 2001 French film Amelie. All the greenish tints, the music, the film's style. The film seemed so stuck in the early 2000s. Then it dawned on me as the film progressed that it was simply a hodgepodge of other films I had already seen. King Kong, The Creature From the Black Lagoon, Every Tim Burton movie, La La Land, Man of Steel, and of course Amelie. By the end I wasn't impressed at all with the film.Del Toro, like Tim Burton, seems to be trapped in an infantile landscape where everything has to look Gothic, everything is quirky and weird. His films look dated. In 20 years, I think people will look back at this film and go ""Why?"". Del Toro IS overrated. His films have always been mainly ""ok"". I've never seen the genius in his work. He isn't a Kubrick or even an Inarritu. He made Pacific Rim, for god's sake!His sets seem as artificial as anything out of George Lucas's prequel trilogy. His characters are caricatures we've all seen hundreds of times. The weird lighting, the puke green tints straight out of 2001.There were no original ideas here. And a lot of the ones ON display were pretty dumb.....the scene where Elisa puts a towel under her bathroom door and is somehow able to fill the entire bathroom from the floor to the ceiling with water so her and the monster can do the nasty...how is that water being held in????Another dumb plot device was that Elisa has to wait for a canal to be opened so the creature can escape into the sea....even though the creature could have just walked to the edge of the dock and jumped into the ocean....There wasn't a fence or anything...but NO, he for some reason has to jump into the canal FIRST and wait a month for the opportunity to escape?Really, the only thing I LIKED about the movie were the actors. The screenplay didn't give them much to work with, but they wrung as much of a performance out of as they could, with Bill Hader being the standout more than Sally Hawkins. Michael Stuhlberg as a Russian spy also did a marvelous job.This movie is worth seeing ONCE. But like most of Del Toro's movies, I will probably never revisit it again.","3.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Terrible.  Absolute Waste of Time.","Zalmorion the Fantastic","Why? Why did they ruin a beautifully filmed movie with excellent creature effects and excellent settings? The attention to detail was impressive.This could have been one of the creepiest, most magical tales. Instead, a woman has sex with a fish man. No one is afraid of the giant fish man who eats cats' heads and bites off the fingers of his captors. No one is surprised by the sexual relationship between the woman and the giant fish man. No one is grossed out. They are ... delighted!?!Who writes nonsense like this?What could have been a classic monster movie with uplifting messages LITERALLY TURNED INTO A MUSICAL!!! Yes, after the gross sex scenes--one of which sees the woman fill an entire bathroom with water by simply putting a TOWEL under the bathroom door--the fish man and the mute sing and dance on stage. I fish you NOT.The women talk about the fish man's penis in a giddy conversation. In a secret government research facility. After having cleaned gallons of blood from the floor of the fish creature's room!?! The best friend is happy for the mute who is having sex with the giant fish as if she just got engaged.I am rarely stunned by the stupidity of Hollywood, its blatant social agendas, its lack of creativity, its lack of understanding of everyday people, and its hypocrisy. But THIS!?!I laughed a lot. I was disappointed, yes. The Shape of Water is an example of mentally imbalanced fringes of society ruining what should have been an amazing film. This is a film about diversity and acceptance and anything goes. It pushes its agenda so far that it dives into the ludicrous and offensive--without even realizing how disgusting and twisted it has become.Imagine, if you will, a chimpanzee instead of the fish man. A creature that is genetically almost us. This film excuses inhumane and perverted relationships with animals, if they are intelligent enough.The acting? Impeccable. The characters? At first, amazing and lovable. The gay friend suffering in a society quite hostile, hiding out for his own safety. The twisted villain/hunter who will do anything, is sexist, racist, and possibly a rapist. The soulless general who reveals the cruel, mindless intentions of the US Government. The Russian spy with a humane streak. The African American best friend struggling under racism, yet demonstrating the most personal strength. The sexism of the time period. The mute protagonist who struggles in stride. ALL THROWN OUT THE WINDOW for aquatic sex and a musical number!!!Even the fish man's backstory was intriguing!! But nothing is done with it. Sad.","1.0 "
"The Shape of Water","A forgetful average movie","Lynn","I do not think the movie is nearly as great as pumped up to be, it is just OK at best.  It is a very shallow science fiction film, not thought provoking or mind blowing in anyway; not in its story line or in its imagination.  The story is rather conventional and the characters are not well developed, almost every single one of them is one dimensional.  The story does not move your emotions, it does not make you sad or angry or happy.  I do not think it will become a classic, it will be forgotten by true movie fans.  Academy award has become a joke, this is yet another example.","3.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Cold War fable is an original...","The Movie Man","“The Shape of Water” takes place in Baltimore in the early 1960s. Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is a mute woman who lives by a set routine. Every day, she makes a hard-boiled egg and checks in with her unemployed artist neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins) before going to her night shift job as cleaning woman at a government lab. Her job is brightened by the company of her chatty co-worker, Zelda (Octavia Spencer).Her sense of order is disrupted when government agent Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) shows up at the lab with a classified “asset” — an amphibious humanoid creature discovered deep in the South American jungle. Strickland wants the creature dissected and studied. Resident scientist Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg) opposes the idea.Elisa becomes fascinated with the creature and sneaks into the room where he’s kept. Having been brutalized by Strickland, the merman is initially suspicious of Elisa, but when she leaves a hard-boiled egg for him and plays some big band-era music, the two develop a shorthand form of communication and connect on a personal level.The creature, played by Doug Jones (“Pan’s Labyrinth”), is inspired by the Creature from the Black Lagoon, though its facial features have been softened to make it more sympathetic and humanistic. Also, the reveal is done matter-of-factly — no shock musical cues, no terrifying close-ups. This is a caged being with a soul — something Elisa sees immediately and connects with. Her reaction is fascination and empathy, not horror.  Using the age-old theme of beauty and the beast, director Guillermo del Toro takes his time showing us how their unusual relationship develops, fabricating a wonderful fairy tale along the way.It takes a skilled director to convincingly combine reality with fantasy, and del Toro succeeds. Shannon’s Strickland is a constant reminder of the harsh tenor of the time, with paranoid fears of Russia coursing through government and society. Strickland is concerned that word of the captive merman will leak and that Soviet spies will get wind of its presence. A group of unlikely allies join forces to free the imprisoned creature, a development that conjures memories of “E.T.” as Elliot and his pals rush to save the extraterrestrial who’s become their friend.Ms. Hawkins is the heart of “The Shape of Water,” conveying innocence, trepidation, and courage as her Elisa deals with an amazing new experience. Because Elisa is mute, Ms. Hawkins must convey without words precisely what’s going though her mind in every scene. She is so adept at this that we always know exactly what she’s thinking and why.Jones has the same task, but his might be more difficult since he has to suggest humanity through a body costume and heavy make-up. The two leads create tremendous screen chemistry, which is essential for the fantasy to work.Director del Toro has affection for monsters, but here his monster is more a gentle beast, terrified at being taken from his home and tortured by a cruel keeper but later realizing that Elisa is a creature not unlike himself in many ways. He thinks, observes, draws conclusions and develops either trust or distrust toward those he encounters. The director saw “Creature From the Black Lagoon” when he was a boy and was disappointed that the monster and the girl didn’t live happily ever after. “The Shape of Water” was del Toro’s opportunity to tell a similar story with a decidedly different point of view.A number of underwater sequences are quite beautiful, with a lyrical elegance not often seen in feature films. Del Toro could have faked the sequences using wires and CGI, but he wanted the actual feel of water to come across. Emotional, even passionate, these scenes - aided by Alexandre Desplat’s score — highlight the film’s romantic theme.Rated R, “The Shape of Water” is a spellbinding mash-up of science fiction, romance, thriller, and comedy. Guillermo del Toro weaves a cinematic spell in one of the best films of 2107Bonus materials on the 2-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include the featurette “A Fairy Tale for Troubled Times;” a conversation with artist James Jean; “Anatomy of a Scene: Prologue;” “Anatomy of a Scene: The Dance;” Guillermo del Toro’s Master Class; and theatrical trailers.

"The Shape of Water","A beautiful adult fairy tale by the brilliant director of “Pan’s Labyrinth”","Robert Blenheim","Guillermo del Toro is today’s master of fantasy, having been a childhood lover of monsters growing up in Guadalajara, Mexico, before making some of the finest films of recent years -- from the ghostly horror of “The Devil’s Backbone” in 2001 to his gothic horror/romance, “Crimson Peak” in 2015.  Indubitably, however, his greatest film is “Pan’s Labyrinth”, the 2006 film many of us consider the finest fantasy film ever made.  Now he’s broken new ground with “The Shape of Water”, one of 2017’s most beautiful films.Set in Baltimore in the year 1962 at the height of the Cold War, the plot follows a mute janitor at a secret government laboratory who forms a bond with a captured amphibian of the “Creature of the Black Lagoon” variety.  Her name is Elisa, and Sally Hawkins plays her with an artistry that seems to reach back to the silent days of Chaplin and Keaton.  Michael Shannon, with devoted viciousness, plays the right-wing Colonel Strickland, someone more interested in dissecting the creature for exploitation purposes than he is concerned over the space race with the Soviets. There are also elements of religious allegory (“We’re created in the Lord’s image.  You don’t think that’s what the Lord looks like, do you?”).Del Toro saw “The Creature from the Black Lagoon” on TV at 7 years old and it changed his life. Wishing a different ending for it in which the Gill Man and co-star Julie Adams would consummate their romance and live ‘happily ever after’, he wrote various scripts of a remake through the years that Universal studio executives wound up rejecting.  “The Shape of Water” is the result of del Toro’s dream, and now today, with more permissive filmmaking allowable, he’s able to deal with the previously verboten issue between fish and human.  The resulting film is a worthy accomplishment not only for its production design (embodying various shades of green) and its special effects, but also for attaining the level of a genuine adult fairy tale that deals with issues of trust, tolerance, and love in the human condition -- but most of all what it’s like to be an outsider (whether a lonely mute woman, gay man, overweight black woman, or an amphibious sea creature).  “This is a healing movie for me,” del Toro states; one likes to think it would be for viewers as well.","5.0 "

"The Shape of Water","Otherworldy Aquamarine Romantic Dream for a Rainy Afternoon","Twittzrich","The early 60s era captured in this movie, with its evocative vintage feel, music and wistful use of sea greens contrasted by passionate brushstrokes of red that encircled the mesmerizing, otherworldly aquatic theme was romantic and dreamy.  The acting was superb and actors well cast.  The movie was suspenseful, intense, poignant and moving.  The reason why I give this film 4 out of 5 possible stars is because of the following reasons: 1. This should have been a family movie with a wider reach.  The movie was a great vehicle for why bullying, inhumane treatment of other species and close-mindedness should not be tolerated, yet the gratuitous sex and violence rendered it an adult movie.2. The nudity and sex was not necessary or enjoyable to watch and didn't elevate the film.  Longing for love and romance are strong enough motivators and that alone would have made the movie more powerful if that had been demonstrated and built upon more. And, if the heroine would have immersed herself, fully dressed into the water in the bathroom scene (instead of taking off all of her clothes) it would have seemed more like abandonment of her senses, oblivious to everything around her in a total devil-may-care surrender in giving her heart.  It would have had a greater impact like the poster of the movie where she is dressed in a red dress with her one of her high-heeled red pumps falling off.  If she hadn't been dressed in that money shot, the impact would not been as compelling. This was not a sexy image or sexy movie, it was about love, acceptance, belonging and understanding.3.  The ""bad guy"" in the movie with the wife and kids should have had a smidgen of something reminiscent of a redeeming quality.  The relationship with his wife and kids was an opportunity to show another side to him instead of painting him as one-sided.  That way, viewers could understand what drove him, besides not being perceived as a failure, unless the movie explained his ruthlessness with a memory scene or something.4.  Although it fit into the theme, the scene in the pie diner seemed a little too convenient. An opportunity presented itself to show racism and homophobia all in one fell swoop.All of the above being said, I really like this movie and would watch it again and I recommend it.  A great movie to watch on a rainy afternoon!","4.0 "

There is always a macabre atmosphere to Del Toro's work and I loved Pan's Labyrinth, but this film was simply a recycled tale. There was nothing new about it, except the dystopian-ish setting which was splayed over by color symbolism that made no sense. Why the color green is so prominent is beyond comprehension. It was Beauty and the Beast meets x-men with a sappy, unbelievable happy ending. I spent most of this movie thinking that I had seen it before and I have, we all have. The Oscars must be confused to give this movie any place at all, much less awards. The movie is completely contrived and unoriginal. The fact that there is a controversy surrounding the idea of the film's origination is completely legitimate. Watch a different film. Disney did it better in cartoon form without all the gratuitous inappropriate scenes. The only reason to watch the film is for Octavia Spencer's performance, she is stellar in her role.","1.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Creature From the Black Lagoon (2017)","J. Weaver","I liked the look of the film, in general, though not of the creature, in particular.  I liked the actors who were cast.  Unfortunately, there is only so much that can be done with a poorly written script.  I found the characters to be shallow and unlikable, the dialogue to be stilted, and the story, as a whole, to be similar to a B-horror flick from the 1950's.  There is no way I would ever believe that this movie was worthy of an Oscar.  It is a 2017 reboot of The Creature from the Black Lagoon.","2.0 "

The acting is the only reason I give this 4 stars, otherwise it would be a 3 star film for me.  Did it deserve to win the Oscar for Best Picture?

This was not intended to be a funny scene. This wasn't intended to be a fantasy or Jacob's Ladder type situation. Nope, this was presented as a real scene in a serious movie.The characters aren't believable or likable (except maybe for the scientist). The writing is very poor. There are no surprises. We get hit over the head with every major plot point. Hmmm.... I wonder why she has those strange scars on her neck that get mentioned by other characters and shown prominently to the audience every half hour? The basic setup is absurd: the fishman is brought to a secure facility but the maids have the security code to the lab and there are no security cameras in the lab so the main character has time to teach the fishman sign language and play music for him.

"The Shape of Water","At first it was sorta weird but once you break it down it is actually pretty good","Tai","I was captivated by this movie and the acting was the best part hands down. While watching it I did find it weird at points (like the sex scenes) and I was actually going to give it 3 stars but now that I am going over it in my head I gave it 4 stars. Here is this girl who is mute and feels alone (even though she has 2 good friends) but she feels like an outcast because she doesn't talk. Then here comes this creature (or asset as they call it) who also is different and can't talk either. There is an instant connection because they have common ground being non-verbal and their lives are much brighter now knowing that they are not alone. At first I didn't know why put in the masturbation scenes but I kind of get it now. Sex is human nature but she is lonely so she turns to masturbation to satisfy the need. It only makes sense when she first has sex with the asset because without the masturbation scenes it looks like she just wants to have sex with it but with the scenes you know she wants more than just sex, she wants to feel the touch of another. The only parts I felt were unnecessary were the scene when Strickland was having sex with his wife and just all the scenes with Strickland's family. They had no significant roles in it, it was just like ""here's this jerk who goes home to his loving family as he slowly goes crazy."" They should have at least had the family try to talk to him about work or something. The only thing I wished it had was an origin story about Elisa. She was found in a river as a child with 3-4 scratch mark scars on each side of her neck but that is all they tell you. Although I love the unsolved mystery I just would also like to know if she was a creature too (or if she was scratched by one) because it's not a coincidence that she just so happened to be in a river with exactly 3-4 scars that look like gills (in fact the asset even turns them into gills). Overall it was a good movie.","4.0 "
"The Shape of Water","""Inventive"" is perhaps the best word to describe this movie","Christopher Schwinger","The Shape of Water is a genre-defying movie, really deserving to be called its own entity.  I'd never seen a movie directed by Guillermo del Toro.  He likes smooth curvy camera movements and somehow manages to be suspenseful at just the right times, beautifully atmospheric just the right times, and has a good control over pace and all the other elements of filming.  I could've done without the several scenes of nudity and frank sexual talk, but those are only a small portion of the film.  It's kind of like the Little Mermaid story in reverse, wherein a mute woman working at a Cold War research facility wants to spend her life with a humanoid sea creature.  Leonard Maltin's review, which you can find with a simple Google search, is what drew me to see this, in spite of the trailers seeming creepy to me.  The mute woman, played by Sally Hawkins who had played the titular social misfit in ""Maudie"" which came out earlier this year, falls in love with the sea creature and undertakes a rescue mission to free him from the cruel authority at the research facility, played by Michael Shannon.  There's an amusing scene where her lovemaking with the sea creature causes leaking in the movie theater below her home.  She has an artist friend who lives right by her and a black woman coworker, who share a special bond with her also, and they work with her to try to free the sea creature and release him back to the ocean.  Leonard Maltin's review says ""As usual, it has been germinating in del Toro’s mind for years. He says it dates back to the moment when, at age six, he first saw the hypnotic image of Julie Adams swimming in a white bathing suit while the Creature from the Black Lagoon stares at her underwater. It’s easy to see how that scene would imprint itself on a boy’s imagination…but what he has given us is not a remake. The Shape of Water alludes to the earlier movie, but it’s a richly detailed piece of work all its own, a dark fairy tale that is not meant for children.""  The visual imagination is really interesting in the movie.  The ending wasn't quite as happy as I had hoped for.  I guess you could call it similar to an opera or the Swan Lake ballet in that love is stronger than death--and if you know anything about either, then you know what I'm saying without me specifying ""spoilers"".  Alexandre Desplat, one of the few movie composers who writes melodic music instead of just mood music, wrote a love theme for this movie which is rather interesting.  I'd see it was worth seeing even though I wanted a different ending and a less open look at sexuality.","3.0 "

"The Shape of Water","A waste of time that will make you question his finer and earlier work.","Devours","Extremely weak and disappointing film.  Del Toro takes great delight in removing the audience for a few seconds by repetitive and crude one word or unnecessary scenes.  I am all for sex in film if it drives the story forward, but what should've been a delicate redo of films like 'Creature of the Black Lagoon' it became more of a self absorbed account of his inner self.  Even as he accepted awards he admitted he felt like the monster, never getting the girl, having the power now to put stories like on film.  But being a fan of his earlier film PL and Hellboy and his imagination in general, this felt juvenile and very rushed.  Way too many scenes with the cartoonish villain (a usually brilliant Michael Shannon), and so there is very build up between the creature and the female lead.  It is not natural how this connection is done so quickly.  She is quite a pathetic character with no real beauty of her own.  Her being mute was done poorly, she has very little skill or chemistry on screen to really capture your eye.  The one truly emotional scene is when she is pleading with her neighbor to save the creature.  Done well but overall I wanted more of a connection and less vigorous masturbation and one liners against an almost childlike score and back drop.  I feel that Del Toro absolutely missed the mark with this film.  That it almost had a sadistic pulse and cruel scenes without particular solutions.  A common theme for art-type films who want awards and tackle social injustice or traits that make you feel ashamed to be part of humankind, yet glossed over with seductive visuals.  I simply did not believe that they fell in love, let alone sex in her bathroom....does not matter how pretty the scene looks.  A fine film will resonate with a powerful and well told story.","2.0 "

One gut-wrenching scene made me lose all sympathy for who you're supposed to root for and actually hope that the ""villain"" wins.I hate ""magic realism"" but many Latin American directors love it. Read some Gabriel Garcia Marquez if you don't know what I mean. I think it's a cultural thing that came from having to put up with dictators or poverty-stricken governments where people hated reality so much they had to fantasize in order to survive. Now, I do enjoy ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""the Outer Limits"" - the difference between those US-made fantasy shows and the Latin American version, however, is that there's no real logic behind ""magic realism"" - it's just wishful thinking coming true.The photography and music are beautiful but the story is simple-minded: the people are either all-good or all-bad. And yet there's nudity and gore aplenty to remind you that it's an ""adult"" film. This trifle shouldn't have won Best Picture. Except for the Russian character (who was complex), everybody was a cartoon character. And the unnecessary brutality towards a cat makes this movie unforgivable in my book.","1.0 "

"The Shape of Water","A beautiful love story and an instant classic!","Adam B. Bugay","Guillermo del Toro is a master of the science fiction film genre. He has directed some of my favorite films over the years, including the gory but fun Dead Alive horror film, the sensational foreign fantasy film Pan's Labyrinth, the thrill ride behind the Hellboy films, the need no introduction The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the newer The Hobbit trilogy as well. His newest fantasy film, The Shape of Water, centers around a tale of forbidden love, and it's fantastic. Since this film is still in theaters, I will provide a quick, spoiler-free review. The film has strong acting performances by the main cast, a gripping story line, and a creature that looks great, and Doug Jones does a wonderful job in creating a wild, but intelligent creature, and is the center piece in showing how our actions and emotional responses to other living beings helps shape how we grow up and view the world around us. The villain in the movie chooses violence and fear, while our unexpected heroine chooses compassion and love as her tools of communication. That's all from me for now, I plan to do a full-length spoiler filled review in the near future. In the meantime, head to the theater and enjoy this wonderfully unique film!","4.0 "

I got to watch it because of its 13 nominations for Academy Awards but I was rather disappointed. Although Guillermo del Toro's dreamy directing is excellent, the fantasy part of the story went too far in my opinion, and made the whole film totally unrealistic. The hypothesis that some ordinary clean-up women would be in everyday free contact with a top secret alien ""creature"" which is under scientific investigation, is totally unconvincing. Even if you consider the story to be just an allegory, it is too big a lie to be believable. I would not bother to watch it a second time.","3.0 "

Compared to this travesty Ed Wood's films are Gone With the Wind, even his notorious  ""Plan Nine."" This movie is truly scary, but mot in the usual sense. It is frightening that it won the Oscar and that so many people liked it, a really ominous indicator of how low the public intellect has sunk. That is terrifying. The most dangerous weapon in the word is not the nuclear threat, it is rampant ignorance and stupidity and wearing them as a badge of honor.

Once we get to know him, we find out that he is in reality a very nice guy...if you feed him hard-boiled eggs and don't let him near cats.Comparisons have been made between this story and Beauty and the Beast. The big difference is that in Beauty and the Beast, the beast becomes a human at the end, while in The Shape of Water, the beauty becomes a beast, or at least an amphibian creature.The film is reminiscent of Splice, a film about the creation of a human-animal chimera. In fact, one of Splice's producers was del Toro, who seems to be fascinated by the idea of combining human and animal DNA.Del Toro has followed Hollywood's guidelines on good and bad types. Good types: non-human creature, handicapped white woman, white homosexual, woman of color, Russian scientist. Bad types: white colonel, white general, Russian government agents, heterosexual white waiter, family.The film succeeds in delivering its anti-American, anti-family, anti-human message, but because of its stock characters and predictable and familiar situations, it is not particularly compelling as a propaganda film.","1.0 "

"The Shape of Water","Thematically Unusual and Visually Striking","drqshadow","In this unusual mesh of fantasy, romance and science fiction, a mute woman working as a lab custodian in the late 60s falls for an abused, captive sea monster. The film dons many hats, several at the same time, which distract and compete for attention: that central relationship, the military's plans for the creature, a neighbor's quest to reclaim his job with an ad agency, a coworker's marriage, a supervisor's frustrated home life. Each adds a layer to the onion skin, and color to the world, but ultimately they feel like light diversions from the main course. On a technical level, it's exceptional. Guillermo del Toro's work has never been short on conceptual know-how, and The Shape of Water merely continues his habit of one-upping the preceding film. The beast itself, heavily influenced by The Creature from the Black Lagoon with a hint or two of Abe Sapien from del Toro's Hellboy, looks fantastic. Lifelike and expressive, it's easy to buy into as a thinking, feeling participant in the story. Sally Hawkins is wonderful as the human lead, drawing inspiration from dozens of classic silent films in her flourishing role as a mousey, passionate, eloquent young woman. Set designs, too, are distinct and remarkable, from the slimy, clinical confines of the military science lab to her crusty, crumbling apartment just above an active movie theater. The plot drags, though, and more than once edges awfully close to cliche. I enjoyed it, particularly on a thematic level, but I wish it was about twenty minutes shorter.","3.0 "
"The Shape of Water","Beauty and The Beast meets The Little Mermaid","Narnia","This film is disturbing. Feels like it's full of cliches, and has been done before.

The music and the colors and some of the scenes are beautifully done, and her sincerity in her feelings toward the creature are also beautifully portrayed, but Toro never lets you forget that this creature is a thing. ""It"" communicates. ""It"" feels. ""It"" can be violent. She falls in love with ""it"", and they do have sex though you don't actually see the encounter. I loved the main character and her best friend ; their lives were sad and you really felt sorry for them. The rest of the characters were kind of type-cast and forgettable. Despite its beauty I am left with a feeling of disgust with the film overall, but I wonder if Toro is trying to give his audience a taste of what ""The Little Mermaid"" would have really been like. Suddenly, the romance seems to wane. It's the elephant in the room - mermaids and merman are actually humanoid fish which look like an experiment gone wrong. Maybe his high level of intelligence, ability to walk and stand on two feet, and working male-parts fooled Elisa into believing that she was falling in love with a man, but despite the poor opinions held by the villains in the film, I have to agree with them on one thing, he is a beast. This film also kind of reminds me of ""Lady In The Water"", at least from what I've read and the few scenes I have caught when it's been aired. Ironically, I've enjoyed cross-species pairing when the love interests actually look human (Edward Cullen, Gamora, etc.), but this really disturbed me because it felt like bestiality. Maybe that was Toro's purpose? To show us what cross-species pairing actually looks like, and that you'd have to be lonely and desperate to fall in love with something that looked like that whereas most main characters will fall in love with a pretty face with green or pink skin? I don't know. In any case, I was not a fan.","2.0 "

"The Shape of Water","meh","D","eh, what a hyped up movie.possible spoilers:bad writing that did not at all feel period appropriate. the romance wasn't very romantic and not because it's with a monster, it just seemed forced and purely about objectifying the creature sexually. sally hawkins and richard jenkins especially gave good performances, but they didn't have much to work with it. a few editing mistakes like eliza's scar switching sides, one bad scene swipe transition that was awkwardly the only one in the movie. it just felt sloppy and too heavily reliant on its cinematography, set design and decoration. too much nudity/masturbation that seemed gratuitous and pointless. now i know every detail of sally hawkins's ass i guess. lots of plot inconsistencies in both the actions and responses of characters. the michael shannon sex scene was completely unnecessary, on top of all of eliza's nudity, and the vulgarity in the script, to the point where i couldn't help but feel creeped out by del toro's choices as if he thinks he's the manic pixie dream quentin tarantino all of a sudden. it wasn't the worst movie, but it was cloying and silly. the ideas and the cast had potential--a small mute woman and black woman who are cleaning ladies, a gay man who's rejected, a creature from another place, a russian scientist posing as american...what a great group of misfits representing ""the other"" as the director loves pointing out. only, the writing felt so current that none of them felt like outcasts and the two nods to civil rights in those days were so brief and unimportant, only serving to illustrate a white man's (jenkins) discomfort. meh. pan's labyrinth was moving, haunting and beautiful, and this just felt like ""guillermo del toro does hollywood""","2.0 "

It wanted to make itself interesting, but it really just relied on vapid characters with zero emotional connections to anything.  I really was mad that I spent 2.99 on something so awful.  Here is a list of things that were stupid, so don't continue reading if you don't want spoilers.1. The creature was seduced with eggs.  Come on, eggs don't make you feel sexy.  They are kind of gross and you need tons of salt.2. The mute woman is pretty ugly and not exactly an interesting character.  She is actually really, really boring.  I'm pretty sure the only reason they made her mute was because it was the only way to give a boring character some mystery.  It didn't work3.  The creature was cool, but never got a chance to show it.  He seemed pretty powerful at the end- but it was too late.  All that time spent watching the movie, and only in the last few seconds did the creature show any cool sides of himself, but by then we were both almost asleep.4. The creature human sex- snooze.  It could have been so much more cool, but I guess if you really are into that, then the 1 second the film gives for this would be enough- but I don't know because I was staring at the wall, waiting for the movie to just be OVER!!5.

Each scene was pretty predictable, because I've seen the movie Splash- and that was way more interesting.In fact, just watch Splash- it was a better movie, had better acting, and was more romantic.","1.0 "

"The Shape of Water","Low Hanging Fruit","Julian Pope","Let me start out by prefacing this review with the fact that I usually LOVE Guillermo Del Toro's movies, and I mean much more than your average viewer. They are consistently some of the best in modern fantasy escapist cinema and he understands the use of color like very few filmmakers do. Another rarity he practices is the implementation of practical FX, makeup and prosthetics BEFORE he will go to using CG, something special.But to me this movie was just too easy, it was very low hanging fruit to be used very obviously and fairly forcefully as a commentary on ""Trump's America"". The story is incredibly simplistic and predictable, the characters are all pretty one dimensional clichés, and Michael Shannon's character was a prototypical ""evil authority figure"". Thats not to mention that he was filled with lots of generic attributes and dialogue.Aesthetically the movie is pleasing, as you would expect it to be in the hands of Del Toro. Guillermo has a penchant for romanticizing time periods and he created a pretty, yet at times sterile and bleak, analog world of early Cold War era America. The film has some other strange ""oddities"" to it, even more than to be expected from the filmmaker. Unfortunately it fails with it's heavy-handedness creating essentially a story all too similar to ""Beauty and the Beast"" with elements of ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"".","3.0 "

"The Shape of Water","A Warm Fuzzy Nostalgic Romance Against The Odds Nearly Thwarted By Evil American Agents.  Old Men Are Worse Than Fish.","Gryphonisle","It has to be an achievement of some sort that a sexual relationship between a fish-man and a human woman is not drawing the least criticism--whereas King Kong's fingering of Fay Ray was once intended as a conscious racist message.At its best, ""The Shape Of Water"" is a romance-against-the-odds, a woman who can't talk who finds a hunky fish-man who sees her for what she is, and not what she isn't.  What caused the scars on her neck never really comes up.  Eliza (an hispanic woman) lives in a contentious time, in the geographic center of much of that domestic contention:  The South.  Yet, despite a movie that is set within a heavily nostalgic world created by TV clips of classic Hollywood movies, old TV shows and lovely music from early to mid century America, only one video reference to the race hatred of the region, and the struggle against it ever shows up.  It should be noted that the original music was written by Alexandre Desplat, and as such, inadvertently evokes ""Julie and Julia""  completely out of context.  As I suspected at the time, Desplat wrote the music for both movies..This could, and probably should, have been a movie about an interracial relationship in the South of that period, complicated by the fears and dark realities of the Cold War.  But that it is not.  The complication here is not the idea that a woman makes love to a fish---and floods an apartment bathroom to do it---but the Cold War and an Evil American Agent who is out to kill her fish.  Oh, and he's a racist pig and a sexual predator.  My God, Satan incarnate!At least this year...The film is beautiful to watch, tells an easy to swallow story, and if you're one of the millions who are resistant to the inconvenience of thinking, you will easily be able to go along for the ride.  To me though, this film reminds me of the way my parents express their deeply closeted racism---and think it's anything but.  They'll describe a non-white friend of Dad's from down at the American Legion and list his attributes, attributes they never apply to any of their white friends.  In their mind they're demonstrating what an exemplar this man is---not realizing that by doing so they're also demonstrating that in their eyes, his attributes are singular:  ""...unlike Other Black People.  Gay people, Chinese people, Mexicans---etc"".  Eliza's best friend is an old white illustrator losing out to camera work.  She makes no effort to seduce him (yet immediately falls for a fish)---and eventually in a very brief scene we learn he's gay.  But nobody, Eliza included, has been clued into this by the script so she could have been going after him, given he sees her for everything she is, rather than what she isn't (can't talk).  Old Men then are more repulsive than fish?  And what of that black angle---it is the South, in the 1950's, but no none of that either.  Is this a trend---a story set in the midst of a turning point in history, but which ignores the cataclysmic event?  I've seen films set in Germany, and in France, during WW2, where the War has absolutely no part in the character's lives and is only briefly acknowledged in the film, off stage.Why depress the audience when so few people are going to theaters to begin with?And what about that trope of the Evil American Agent.  Isn't that one thing we Americans--Trumples, Clintonites, Berns all have in common, we're so willing to accept them as a Hollywood monster, akin to King Kong, Zombies, and Vampires?  But shouldn't Hollywood reconsider and show such men as the traitors they are?  We just had an incoming President, so paranoid about Evil American Agents spying on his transition team he didn't just go to London, Paris or Berlin to set up a spy-proof back channel, he went to Russia!!!  That to me says the trope has become so culturally ingrained that it's time to kill it.  I'd say it's about time Hollywood stop using this trope altogether, or start making a more clear distinction that these evil American agents are actually lost souls, blind to the Cause, so forgetful of what they're fighting for they're actually working against America's values.Hollywood needs to stop using American agents as monsters like any other, at this point it amounts to sedition.Ah well, as I said, you won't have to think of any of that.  You can very easily just sit back and go along for the ride, and if Evil American Agents don't drag you off to the Camps as you leave the theater, well there you are.And if you wait to stream this, you'll also miss the mind numbing forty minutes of repeated commercials and trailers we had to sit through at the local cineplex---theaters are having a hard time what with the internet and big flat screen TVs, but when I have this experience trying to see a film I've paid for, I take that as another reason to stay home.

This did not feel like a love story, more like an inter species affair and hard to watch story of oppression.

"The Shape of Water","Designed for Oscars voters, not audiences","James Beswick","The Shape of Water is a film made for Oscar voters - it checks all the boxes for the Academy Awards from the constant references to old films, the topical love story, the hero with a physical disability and the leaps into absurdist fantasy. Unfortunately, it's not made for regular audiences, who will probably find the entire premise implausible, the love story unengaging and the concepts difficult to meld into any remotely coherent.There's a lot wrong here. Straight away, it's difficult to fathom why the hero has an instant attraction to the man-fish, which has been captured and tortured by the military in a room with no security. The creature design is bad, barely hiding Doug Jones' near-identical previous performances, and really looking like a man in a suit from a 1950s monster show. The filmmakers struggle with how to convince the audience that there is a sexual attraction between the two and it frankly starts to get a bit weird - there's a reason why Beauty and the Beast doesn't venture there.The overlong running time has plenty of storylines that go nowhere. From a contrived scene in a diner that exists only to show the manager is racist and homophobic, to the sidekick's work problems in the art world, there's a ton of material that could have been cut. We struggled to get through the whole thing. On the plus side, Michael Shannon is good and the production design is basically Bioshock, but for fans of the director it's a real disappointment.","2.0 "

"The Shape of Water","Mute Cleaning Woman Feels Sorry for a Creature Brought to a Top Secret American Facility","James N Simpson","The Shape of Water is a visually interesting film that certainly has some great acting by Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaning lady in a secret government facility in the 1950's that still has posters from the war up such as Loose Lips Might Sink Ships. It's a plot that has been done countless times before, although granted the main character who learns about a strange creature/alien/robot and wants to free it/rescue it, is usually a child or teen (and usually male), rather than a woman in her 40's.  This definitely has a darker vibe to it than ET, Short Circuit, Free Willy and that sort of film, and Sally does stuff with the creature that those kids never did.For me the let downs of this movie were it got a little boring at times, overall it's a little long, it could have been edited and told the same story more efficiently.  I didn't for example see at all what the diner famous for green pie place added to the film other than to remind you this is set in a time where shop keepers could be openly racist. But we saw enough of that with Octavia Spence'rs character to realise that. For a film made in 2017, I was a little disappointed that the creature's head in some shots looked like a guy with goggles on wearing a mask. This would have been fine if the movie was actually made in the 1950's. Some things that happened, the film makers expected us to buy as reality like putting a towel over the crack at the bottom of the door and turning the taps on in a bathroom would make the space behind the closed door fill up with water like the inside of a water tank.  That's just treating you're audience with contempt and like they're idiots.  Likewise without mentioning what it is, but the ending, you're already at a suspended belief level but the ending takes it to a cartoon level, and it's just lazy writing.  It's a shame because it's the ending so when the credits start to roll, the feeling of gee that was ridiculously stupid is the last thought in your mind.  There's also one point where the movie suddenly becomes a musical, if this was a TV series and not a movie you would have said it jumped the shark.I found The Shape of Water to be a film that you didn't end regret watching overall, but it's not one you'd watch a second time","3.0 "

"The Shape of Water","My opinion.","Owln33","My personal oponion:Gone are the day's Where you come away from a movie feeling good, or inspired, or just happy for the enjoyment. This movie could have been so much better. I found the nudity and sexuality unnecessary, especially the multiple singular scenes. The father and the mute girl very disturbing, and just an overall disapointing. It could have been so much more magical, leaving so much to a persons imagination, so that when they come away from the film..they want to continue to think of it... Rather than (like me) hurry up and get it out of my mind. It was stupid and cheesy. What a shame. It could have been so much more. I can not believe this movie won Oscars over so many other worthy films. Weird. Also when will writers and authors stop playing the lgbtg card to gain ratings. People are so disencitized, so shock, discust and suposed to gain viewers. Someone please bring back good writing, where everyone can come away with something great, bring back imagination, magic, guts, and courage to stand out and make something great.

The movie was simply brutal and showed the worst of humanity in many of the scenes directed toward the main character. Some of the scenes left me scratching my head as there was no real purpose or connection to move the movie along to capture the audience's attention as the flow was erratically slow in my opinion.

"The Shape of Water","Overrated","Allison","The film is a standard Beauty and the Beast fantasy tale, only it substitutes the Beast with the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Apparently, the US government captured and is experimenting on a merman in an effort to beat the Soviets in the space race in the 1960's. The film is very heavy handed in being a metaphor for those of us who are treated as outsiders by society at large. So the heroes are the merman (Doug Jones), a handicapped woman (Sally Hawkins), an African-American woman (Octavia Spencer), and a gay man (Richard Jenkins). They must flee the villain--an able bodied, straight, white man played by Michael Shannon. The actors are all very good but the movie turns completely ridiculous when the Sally Hawkins character strips naked and starts sleeping with the fish man. Even the Richard Jenkins character acknowledges that the merman is a wild animal. So the Hawkins character is committing bestiality. I find that disturbing, not romantic at all. I also found a lot of the sexuality and gory violence cringe worthy, and I think the director could have removed a lot of that and the movie would have been better for it. I feel this one has been overrated by the critics.","2.0 "

"The Shape of Water","Predictable and Overhyped Oscar Buzz","Amazon Customer","Short Version: Predictable and spoiled by Red Ban Trailer as well as unnecessary Beastiality.Actual Review: I preface this by saying I'm a big Guillermo Del Toro fan since i saw Pan's Labyrynth as a kid. Since then i enjoyed Hellboy 1 and 2 and loved Pacific Rim. When this movies trailer dropped i was curious and excited, it was unique and seemed beautiful. I was looking forward to how this Romance would come to be.  And then the red ban trailer dropped. In hindsight the ""Red Ban"" could just as easily mean whole movie except for the End, so don't watch that if your considering renting or buying this. But that is not why it's predictable entirely, that falls solely early in the movie. We are introduced to our Main Character a mute who is very lonely, and thirsty. That is her character. You then have her two friends, one is her neighbor a funny and helpful artist on a downpoint in his life. The other is her co worker who looks out for her and helps speak for her at work, Its a shame her accent is so God Damned played up and annoying. Then we come to our Antogonist played by Michael Shannon playing Most of Michael Shannons roles, a mean creep with no redeeming quality. Solely there to root against. Lastly our 🌟 and selling point for this movie, The FishMan! A cool and great looking creature who is tortured most of the film as well as having a childlike sense of wonder since he is learning new things. Keep in mind i compared it as Child Like. Ok spoilers here on out.  I keep ragging on the trailer, introduces characters and synopsis does that right, but also shows scenes consecutively as they happen in the movie. So heres synopsis of trailer and compare it to the movie if you see it.Lonely Mute Lady has a daily/nightly routine as she goes to work. One night a creature is brought in by a creepy Government Man.  Government man is obviously abusing said Creature and comes out with missing Finger. It is revealed that Main Scientist is a Russian Spy, you know because you have to know that going in not like it could be a twist or anything. Then we get a creepy scene of Government man losing finger which would have been better seeing in the movie for the first time. After said incident she begins seeing creature more and more. She gives him hard boiled eggs and introduces music to him. That is in the trailer, you'd think they did more while making a connection in the movie, but nope, they don't, that is it! Scenes of her feeding him eggs and ""dancing"" with him, THEY'RE IN LOVE NOW! Ignore the fact he is a Fish Man. No scenes of her coming to terms of ""hmmmm this kinda like beastiality"". Back to the Trailer they get him out of the facility, because again we have to know this, not like it ruins any tension in the film as they are getting him out. We find out Scientists cover is blown as well as Government Man coming after Fish Man. That is the Movie! Minus the Ending.  Now for the spoiler early on. Our main character just so happens to have scars on her neck. Not much explanation to how she got them except that she's had them since she was young. Now these scars if you look at them are parallel to eachother, and on both sides of her neck. Hmmmmmm I'm no Detective but hmmmm these scars seem to ressemble DARE I SAY GILLS! In a movie about a Fish Man. Now I'm no Screenwriter either all i have is common sense. This movie was gonna end with her living in the ocean as some fish creature, with the Fish Man obviously, why would she go live in the ocean alone. So there you have the story about how a trailer and specifically placed scars ruined this movie for me.  Lastly their relationship. I had no problem with it until it outright turned sexual. Now it was gonna happen at some point in their lives but it couldn't have happened when they lived in the ocean? because at that point she could have been part fish. But no it happened while he is healing in a tub learning even more now since he was out of the facility. She sees him before heading out but changes her mind and powerwalks back in there. He looks worried as to whats going on, she then strips naked and his eyes widen with his childlike wonder like ""WHAT'S GOING ON"" she then locks the door behind her. It's revealed they had sex, but that scene before she closes the door left an awful taste of ""oh God she just forced herself on him"". Not the case tho because we find out he apparantly has a Dick as she explains it to her friend in one of the most cringiest conversations I've ever seen on film. And only her friend spoke laughing it off like ""you had sex? But How? You wild"" Their love was better innocent and new besides by the end it's implied they are together they could have sex in the future. But gotta have it in your face, was it for humor? I just don't see why it had to be presented like that. It seemed like and older lady coming on to some kid, and yes i know he was old but he was LEARNING ABOUT THE WORLD!  The movie was very aesthetic, but predictable and disturbing. Falls in a long line of gotta keep this person/ creature safe from Government/Bad Guys. Free Willy, Stranger Things, E.T., etc. Mediocre film made more dissapointing for the hype and admiration of the Director. I'd give it 2 1/2 but am unable here.

"The Shape of Water","Reckless Abandon Skips","A. Squire","The movie opens with the camera proceeding through what quickly becomes apparent as an apartment filled / suspended in water. The expectation for me and my fellow viewers was that the water would recede and transition to the actual life being lived by the central character (all plot already having been exposed / ""spoiled""  by the trailer). However, the film skips the receding waters or any transition at all and cuts scene to after the water disappears. This heretofore referred to as the Skip is analogous to how the film deals with all of the issues it attempts to conquer throughout what becomes a tedious and extended 2+ hours.None of the points are fleshed out to the point of showing any progression of the characters or a reason to care for the situation. The issues like the Skip are presented and then quickly moved to the background. Whither to save FX costs or script development it makes no difference. All aspects are presented and without grasping the morality of their consequence or reasoning for their relativity... the film assumes your predispositions and skips ahead with reckless abandon.The skip in the first 45sec-2min of the film coupled with the trailer and movie poster (the one of the beast and the main character in an embrace which I saw walking into the movie and said ""I bet that's the last scene and they swim off like splash."") are all one really needs to see to take in the majority of this film.

A huge facility has been built to house this creature, yet little care is taken to keep it healthy. The bad guy is a ridiculously overdone, perpetually scowling, sadist who tortures the creature for religious reason (I mentioned that Del Toro is a leftist, right?). And of course he's a racist.Del Toro missed a cliche: the sadist's wife likes to have sex with him; usually, the cliche is that the bad guy forces himself on an unwilling wife.The cleaning lady is a lonely, horny, mute who  can waltz into the most secure area anytime she feels like it and ultimately saves the creature and tries to have sex with it.

"The Shape of Water","Del Toro didn't work his usual magic on this one.  No Oscar vote here.","Charles Austin Miller","With all the Oscar talk and plagiarism controversy swirling around it, I don't know what I really expected out of this flick... It has Guillermo del Toro written all over it, undoubtedly, with a surreal atmosphere like a combination of ""Hell Boy"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" as well as a strong ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" vibe.By the way, the Universal Studios ""Creature"" trilogy of the 1950s is one of del Toro's favorite monster treatments, and it's one that he wanted to remake in his own style, but Universal rejected his repeated proposals for years.This movie, however, doesn't really adhere to the aforementioned influences; rather, it enters the realm of Tim Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands,"" with the same simplistic storyline: An intelligent (even ""magical"") monster is brought into a dreamy caricature of ""modern"" mid-20th Century civilization, where it manages to make both loving friends and brutal enemies and eventually escapes back to its remote origins once more.Yes, there is the much-touted love interest between the monster and a human female; but this is no more derivative than ""The Creature"" was derivative of ""King Kong"" or a dozen other films in which the monster falls for the girl.  That's just a time-worn Hollywood trope.I suppose I expected to see the elements that made ""The Shape of Water"" worthy of an Academy Award nomination...and I came away disappointed, because I just don't see it as Oscar-worthy.Production-wise, ""Shape of Water"" is only so-so: the story is a Hollywood standard; the sets are colorful but not especially innovative; the great majority of the monster effects are just latex; the musical score is not particularly memorable; and the acting is only adequate.Then there are the numerous stereotypes: the black and latino ""cleaning ladies"" who become ""empowered""; the bible-thumping white ""big boss man"" who sadistically bullies and tortures and shoots anyone that crosses his path; the ""devious Russians"" who carry out covert operations; and, of course, the ""lonely homosexual"" who has been alienated all his life by 20th Century Western society.Please, Guillermo.  A 21st-Century ""social justice"" monster movie?  Sheesh.These stereotypes are politically-correct cardboard cut-outs (unlike the characters in most del Toro films), which left me thinking that del Toro didn't work his usual magic on this one.So, no.

"The Shape of Water","Almost like watching someone's twisted Hellboy fanfic.","TechnologyHatesMe","Here's a movie pitch. Let's take Abe from Hellboy, take away everything that made him charming and human-like, and turn him into a feral animal. Oh, and we just have to have a progressive political agenda that will only appeal to a certain group of people. And don't forget the porn. The porn just has to be there to make the movie amazing.There's a reason people turn out in masses to see movies like the Avengers. Because they appeal to a large group and aren't biased to an extreme. Changing history to fit a political agenda just leaves a sour taste in the mouth.There is nothing wrong with artistic films. Or even sex in movies. It's just the way it's handled that determines the appeal. There is not a single sex scene from game of thrones that made me more uncomfortable then this film as a whole.And as for the fish beast. When you take away the human element (speech, civil mannerisms, and the same or greater intelligence as a human) it's just bestiality. If it acts like a beast, it is a beast. And I'm not talking about beauty and the beast here. Because Beast may have looked like a beast, but he still acted human, and even then beauty didn't sleep with him. Think about guardians of the galaxy, or star trek or star wars, or even the old Hellboy movies. Some of the characters might be weirdly colored (green, blue, purple, etc) and have horns or scales or tails, but they are still ""human"". There has to be a human element for attraction. If not, it's no better then someone falling in love with their dog or in this case, pet fish. Imagine Hiccup having a romatic relationship with his dragon Toothless. The dragon is smart, caring, and even understands words. But it is still a freaking animal! (Excuse me while I vomit)There are so many better romances out there that don't have a extreme political agenda and scew reality. Even though Hellboy 2 sucked, Abe falling in love with the elf lady was so much better and less creepy. Because at least the fish guy in that wasn't an animal. And a movie can be R rated without making game of thrones look like a kids show on Nickelodeon. If the movie removed the extreme political views (it could have hinted at the real segregation of the 60s instead of making it out to be as bad as Nazi Germany)and made the fish beast more of a fish man who could eventually speak.

"The Shape of Water","Save your money.","Nyxx","I was very disappointed in this movie. It jumps all over the place, and there's no flow between the odd characters that have a tendency to make you feel a bit uncomfortable. . Michael Shannon''s character is unnecessarily crude, stating that he still had his pu$$y fingers left. He's just gross. They could have made him a very bad guy without that. The ""gratuitous"" nudity scenes were lack luster at best, and leaves you with very little sympathy for the #MeToo movement.  Abe''s character was way more romantic in Hellboy. And this story is nothing remotely close to Beauty and the Beast, as some have claimed it to be.  I literally had to force myself thru to the predictable ""shocker"" end. The only reason this won any awards is because that's what Hollywood elites do. Save your money.","1.0 "

"The Shape of Water","Beautiful and Masterful, but has an agenda","SirTherapySquid","I want to first start off this critique with the obvious: this film is amazing!The music is the very first thing that pulls you in and it is the very last thing you hear too. It's powerful, soft, era-accurate, and moving. The music, quite honestly, is what kept this movie together, to begin with. I don't think I would be able to fall in love with the story if the music hadn't invited me. Additionally, the fact that there is a musical scene just really wraps up that time period, but it also says ""I love you"" to classical cinema.The characters are quite interesting, well developed, and didn't feel ""Hollywood."" I personally believe that Hollywood has developed an array of stock characters they tend to dip into. there a couple of new stock characters that show up here: the lonely gay man, yippy black women, and the ""defective"" underdog. Yet, these characters seem so much more than that. Being an actor myself, I can easily see when actors dip into how they ""should"" look like as a character, instead of playing a character truthfully as themselves. That doesn't happen here, thankfully, and it felt like that genuine characters were inhabiting this time and circumstances.Finally, the movie is quite gorgeous to look at. It is beautifully shot, the red shoes are beautifully integrated, and the sea creature is beautifully rendered. The musical segment is truly unique, beautiful, and fun. The outlandish abstract actually brings the movie together: her bathroom filling with water, their relationship, and the ending all quite this beautiful magical realism that is far-fetched enough to be enjoyed but close enough not to take us out of the movie.The reason I give this movie three stars is that, ultimately, the execution of the themes is flawed. I firmly believe that if you want to ""talk"" about political problems using art, you need to find it in your work, first, then elaborate on it. This movie just beats you over the head with the ""societal problems"" that Del Toro mentions he wanted to be in the story. The gay is hated: homophobia is rampant. The black woman is hated: sexism and racism are rampant. The mute is hated: embrace your freak! These character traits could have easily been introduced to the story without any agendas seeming to be shoehorned into the story. What tops it all off, however, is when the antagonist is a white, straight, religious male. It seems to me the writers, including Del Toro, thought of all the minorities' problems and blamed it on one specific group. A specific group I am a part of.  This movie, ultimately, alienated me from its experience. I know the homophobia, racism, and sexism are a problem. I often encourage my students to embrace the freak in them because that's really the only power you have to distinguish yourself. Yet, I went into this movie enjoying it and then left lumped into a group of people that are considered hateful, ignorant, and naive. You can write this off as the straight, white, Christian male complaining-- and that's okay because that's what this is-- but when did we start taking these boxes and prejudices off groups of people and putting them back on another group of people?Look, this is an easy fix. It mostly has to do with Micheal Shannon's character. There is a completely unnecessary scene between him and his wife to show he's straight. There are several moments of religious allegory that is painfully and contritely shoehorned into his ""villainous"" monologues. He was so blatantly the bad guy, everything he did was a huge point that seemed to say, ""Look how evil straight, white, religious men are!"" I'm not making all of this up or reading to deeply because Del Toro mentions it an interview as a goal he set out to achieve. I'm not trying to get political. Quite the opposite, actually. The same message would have been heard louder and clearer if the movie itself didn't have a political agenda. I've seen white, straight, men really hurt people, this is true, but for every one ""evil"" white, straight, religious man I saw, there're hundreds that are not racist, sexist, homophobic, and so forth. I am one of those men. This movie just seemed to want to lump me in with the likes of Trump or West Boro Baptist church and expect me to enjoy it.I really wanted to enjoy this movie so much. It is a great movie! The political agendas just get in the way.","2.0 "

"The Shape of Water","ABE? OR A TOILET STRUGGLING TO FLUSH?  ALSO, THERE IS BEASTIALITY.","Dracula","I have been a fan of Guillermo del Toro for quite a while, and I absolutely loved his Hellboy movies.  So when this film was not available for rent I went ahead and purchased it.  Del Toro is incredibly good at making unforgettable creatures and atmospheres, and he does that again here.  The problem?  ""The Shape of Water"" is an absolutely disgusting movie.No seriously, I mean it's ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING in about every way imaginable.  Abe (or at least, our Abe-like fish man) is visually stunning, but his every scene is overlaid with so many burps and gurgles that its impossible to suspend your disbelief and enjoy the film.  One has a hard time enjoying a character that sounds like a toilet struggling to flush.  Every interaction is a strange string of noises that try to take the place of actual acting and interaction.  But this is the least of the film's atrocious crimes.Our fish man does not speak like Abe from Hellboy.  He is a wild, feral beast.  Del Toro instructed the actor to play him that way, and the movie reminds us on several occasions that he is a wild animal and a 'thing.'  Even the good guys call him a thing.  So you'd assume love would take part in this film the way it did with E.T., or Winnie the Pooh and Christopher Robin.  You expect there to be a bonding and mutual respect, love, not sex.  Well guess what - its a full blown romance movie.  Maybe I should've looked at the genre before watching.  This thing goes full blown bestiality.As if that weren't enough, I don't like watching small animals get killed.  Trigger warning for those who don't want to see that kind of thing - its in this film.  And worst of all, like so many recent films, ""The Shape of Water"" serves up an extra helping of over the top propaganda.  It does a great job portraying the 60s visually, and sure things were different back then, but they weren't as bad as the film portrays them to be or we wouldn't be in the civilization we are today.  It was this civilization that chose to keep embracing liberty - and chose not to throw all of us in camps to prevent it.  So come on now...enough of this equating the 60s to the Holocaust!The film depicts white males as being complete mustachioed villains with no redeeming qualities, it portrays them as being racist, sexist, violent, cruel and Christian.  The film leads the charge on the crusade to divide us of the working class based on skin color. The only good white male in the movie is homosexual and we get to watch him hit on another white male, who ends up being racist and homophobic.  (And why, isnt this movie supposed to be about the main characters?  Why do we need side excursions into sexuality?!)  As always women are portrayed as exempt from the stigmas and labels heaped upon the white males, and they are shown to be completely oppressed by men.  I'm a woman myself, and I'm saying this.  I'm sorry but these stereotypes are not at all what I experienced growing up - I was taught to love my fellow man - and I'm tired of every lick of entertainment being sullied by a soap box against a by-gone era when a vast 90 percent of the people we encounter on a day to day basis are not hung up on these 'evils.'  These 'evils,' by the way, that the Soros funded propaganda machine needs to keep alive in our working class brains so that we don't come together and prosper.Its a miserable movie with a lot of pointless death scenes - drama for drama's sake, and its slow paced.  There's no action - this isn't a fun Hellboy romp or a mysterious Pans Labyrinth.  I sincerely wish I hadn't given a dime for this garbage.","1.0 "

And for the record, I loved The Killing of a Sacred Deer, mother!, and Three Billboards this year, so it's not like I'm some delicate hothouse flower. It's just that at the core of this movie is a fairly standard beauty-and-the-beast storyline that's been done better before, and swirling around that unobjectionable-enough basic romance is a cesspool of ugliness, way more than was needed to demonstrate the loveliness of finding escape from a dismal world in one's true love.

"The Shape of Water","A fishy flop of a movie","David Ljunggren","First off, I have to say del Toro has a certain world view and if you don't share it, you really won't have much fun watching his films. The Shape of Water is pretty awful from start to finish, permeated with clunky dialogue and scenes so lurid and embarrassing (and brutally violent) that I watched some from behind my hands. The message, couched in the Cold War rhetoric of the 1960s, is about loneliness and people being different and how they cope with being lonely and different and the right way to treat and cherish people who are lonely and different. Elisa is a mute cleaner in a secret facility which one day takes delivery of a mysterious male river creature whose ability to breathe both in and out of water could help the space race effort. She starts to bond with the creature and when she learns that the laughably one-dimensional bad guys (there are more than one) want to dissect him, she has to take action. If you like ludicrous plots and artificial strained dialogue of the kind you'll see in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, for example, you'll love this movie. If not, you will groan at the corny scenes and the collections of words that no half sane human being woud utter. It's a fantasy and one that left me cold.

"The Shape of Water","awful","noappliances","This is painful, and offensive. I would have walked out, if I'd been alone at the theater.Extremely bombastic, and hackneyed. Nothing about the story makes any sense. It's hard to get into details without spoilers, but speaking in generalities... The ending relies on a gimmick from an 80's blockbuster, that's been a cliche for decades. The plot is incoherent. The characters are so far beyond caricatures, it's impossible to describe. Imagine, perhaps, a WWII flick where the Nazis fry babies for breakfast, just to establish that they're the bad guys. It's like that: over-the-top to the point of being repulsive, but not in a self-aware way.In one restaurant scene a black couple is on screen for about 30 seconds, entirely for the purpose of having a character tell them they have to leave. They pop in and out of the movie like a jack-in-the-box. The director might just as well have filmed a flashing neon sign reading ""racism"". It is comically bad, and the entire film is like this.The movie tries to be a story of outsiders, of people who feel they don't belong, but it fails utterly. The sub-plot of a gay character, for example, is almost sympathetic, because the actor is very compelling, but the script is so ham-fisted and anachronistic, it is unbelievable.There were so many better movies this year.","1.0 "

"The LEGO NINJAGO Movie","Jump up, kick back, whip around and spin--a TV series gets the film treatment and is as funny and heartfelt as its predecessors","KarToon12","When the Lego Movie first hit theaters, I was skeptical. It looked like a funny enough movie for little kids, but come on--this had ""two hour toy commercial"" written all over it. But thanks to overwhelmingly good word of mouth, I bought the DVD and gave the film a shot....and was completely blown away with how hilarious and heartfelt it was, with powerful messages about the essence of creativity. And since then, I was kicking myself for not having seen it in the theaters. So when a series of sequel/spin off movies were announced, I knew I had to make up for my past mistake and make the trek to theaters to see them. And after greatly enjoying Batman's solo outing, I was curious what this new installment would have in store, especially considering that I never watched the ""Ninjago"" TV show.Anyone who's never seen the Ninjago cartoon series doesn't have to worry. There's more than a few scenes that explain the basic plot of this world and how it works, so that newcomers won't be lost. (Though, I'm sure it's a nice bonus if you HAVE seen the show, as some of the jokes might be better appreciated.) And while the original ""Lego Movie"" was far superior in terms of its plot, this spin off movie still brings plenty of laughs, heartfelt moments, and lessons to learn.The world of Ninjago is a city that is frequently attacked by the evil Lord Garmadon. In response, the city's secret ninja force constantly staves off his attacks, led by the Green Ninja, who is, in reality, a young boy named Lloyd....and Garmadon's son. This fact is known by everyone in the city, and as such, Lloyd is continuously despised and bullied, with everyone (save for his teammates) believing that he'll end up like his father (but ironically, since no one knows Lloyd is the Green Ninja, the city loves and adores him in his alternate persona). Fed up with being the son of a villain and being picked on for it, Lloyd goes against his master's orders and attempts to use a super weapon to defeat Garmadon once and for all.  But all it leads to is the destruction of the city and Garmadon's victory. Now, with the help of his friends, Lloyd must try and undo his mistake, and go on a journey to a hidden temple where the ninjas can unlock their true, hidden potential...and maybe, in the process, help reunite Lloyd's broken family.Okay, stop me if you've heard this one before:  a team of teenagers with attitude, who are color coded for your convenience, have to harness their elemental powers and fight villains and monsters using giant mecha. They have a secret base with a wise old master, and the green leader has ties/is related to one of the villains.......yes, this is basically Lego Power Rangers, right down to taking a few cues from the ""Mighty Morphin"" movie and having the characters lose their abilities, then have to travel to a new mystical location to gain a new set of powers. But that isn't really a bad thing. The film knows that it's utilizing a ton of story clichés' (especially from kung fu movies), so it takes every opportunity to point them out and either subvert them or riff on them. And as always, the soundtrack is catchy, and the animation is as fluid and detailed as the other lego movies (though for some reason, smoke and water effects are no longer lego pieces and are now just digitally rendered to look real. There's also a heavier reliance on live action footage for some of the jokes).As for the characters, once again, as was the case in the Batman film, anyone expecting Emmet, Unikitty, or any of the other characters from ""The Lego Movie"" will be disappointed (save for just a few sly background references here and there).  Master Wu and the ninja team ARE a fun gang to follow around with, though admittedly, they don't get much characterization and fall into the typical stereotypes of ""the cool one"", ""the logical/bookish one"", ""the sporty one"", etc. (My guess is that you'd like them more if you followed the TV show.) The whole plot is centered on Lloyd and his attempts to patch things up with his dad, Garmadon, who, by all accounts, is the funniest character in the whole movie, with his Dr. Evil-ish ignorance of the obvious and the glee he takes in being a villain.And it's at this point that I'm beginning to notice a pattern within this now-trilogy. All the lego movies so far have stuck to the same basic premise of the main character having some sort of family issues--all of which tie into fatherhood and how to be a better parent, which winds up making the lessons arguably more for the adults than for the kids watching. And each film ties up with a ridiculous, over the top finale fight, and ending with a heartfelt speech that wins the villain over and saves the day. While I feel ""The Lego Movie"" had a far more subtle and profound lesson about creativity and being who you are, this film's moral is, while definitely more simple and obvious, still important. In this case, both main characters come away with something. Lloyd learns to be aware of your roots and where you came from, but having a painful past doesn't have to define who you are. And Garmadon comes to understand how important it is to be there for your kids, and that, as a parent, the choices you make, both good and bad, can have serious consequences for how your kids grow up.So while I feel that this film is the weakest of the three in the franchise, it's still a greatly fun ride with plenty of heart and humor that I've come to expect from the lego films. Here's hoping that any future films will be just as entertaining.","4.0 "

I feel really bad for any kids that watched this that came from broken homes. Yeah the garmadon guy was funny, I laughed, but it was seriously messed up.

Maybe I just don’t get out much, but my sister in law and I laughed at most of the jokes. It was a really enjoyable time. I am a fan of the Lego movies in general and really enjoy their humor. They’re movies that I actually find myself wanting to watch again with the kids.The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because my son (age 7), said he didn’t like some of the changes to the Ninjago characters. From what I gather, this movie doesn’t follow along the same story line as the tv show that my kids like. It’s sort of a stand alone with the same characters. It did feel like the individual ninjas were not as developed as they are on the tv show.Other than that, I would recommend this movie and am looking forward to watching it again for family movie night.","4.0 "

Toys are for playing with, they’re not meant to play by themselves.  It’s weird.  Be that as it may, toy issues aside, it is a funny cartoon (of a sort).

"The LEGO NINJAGO Movie","More square-block folk in a third LEGO feature...","The Movie Man","“The Lego Ninjago Movie” is based on a line of toys and a children’s TV series. On an island city, people live in fear of evil Lord Garmadon (voice of Justin Theroux), a multi-armed villain prone to attacking the city. Fortunately, there are six young ninjas on hand to confront him and protect the populace. Among this group is the Green Ninja, Garmadon’s estranged son, Lloyd (Dave Franco), a bullied schoolboy when not in his crime-fighting togs.The other heroes are Kai, the fire ninja (Michael Pena); Cole, the earth ninja (Fred Armisen); Zane, the ice/robot ninja (Zach Woods); Nya, the water ninja (Abbi Jacobson); and Jay, the lightning ninja (Kumail Ninjiani). The film is a hybrid of martial arts, giant monster, and mechanical robots set in a Asian-type metropolis. While Garmadon repeatedly terrorizes the citizens of Ninjago, Lloyd is hated at school because of his father, not realizing about their classmate’s heroic double life. Eventually, Lloyd must incorporate his training from Master Wu (Jackie Chan) to use the power of teamwork and reconnect with his father.Despite the serious plot, the movie is filled with attempts at humor, some of which work, but mostly fall flat. With three credited directors, the movie lacks single focus. This moviemaking by committee doesn’t really work. A single director would have given the film a more straightforward narrative.This is the third Lego feature film, and Warners is evidently attempting to make this into a franchise. This installment has the most exotic setting yet, and emphasizes the importance of teamwork in facing up to supposedly insurmountable obstacles.Bonus materials the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include 3 behind-the-scenes making-of featurettes; 3 mini-movies; 3 music videos; 3 deleted scenes; outtakes; commentary by co-director Charlie Bean and crew; and 13 promotional videos.

"The LEGO NINJAGO Movie","Great visuals, great comedy, great music, but most importantly it has a great message.","Farooq Syed","This really is a fantastic movie.  I know it's only at 55% on Rotten Tomatoes but I can't for the life of me understand why.  It looks amazing, is hilarious, but most importantly has a great message. The main moral revolves around the importance of family and forgiveness and the movies does this theme justice with strong characterization of Lloyd and his father.  Teamwork and individuality are also well represented.  I was surprised by how much life and humanity was found in this film about plastic bricks but it could not have been presented in a better way.  Even though the film is not afraid to slow down and get real, it's more than happy to pick up the pace for some fast comedy.  The jokes have a strong improv style and I was laughing my head off at almost every one.  If you liked the Lego Movie or the Lego Batman movie you will like this one.  If you just want to see a funny movie watch this film.  But most importantly, if you want so see a film with a lot of heart with your family you give this movie a shot.","5.0 "

Silly, stupid, cheesy, just funny all around & not taking it so seriously.  Come on a bunch of hot guys & gals running around in the smallest swimsuits ever trying to solve crime...uh yeah, how many times in rehearsal did they have ""ooops"" moments?  They could totally have an entire movie on bloopers alone, I have NO doubt!  It was GREAT having the cameo appearances, even if they both may or may not have actually been there.  I agree with some of the other reviewers in wanting to see the 2nd one & try getting some of the other ""OG's"" to pop in!  It's just really great nostalgia for those of us who were major Baywatchers!  You got an awesome new team-go with it!  Oh, couldn't give it a 5 though, sometimes it slowed down & some of it I don't even think was needed, or maybe could have been tweaked a bit...like the relationship with the cop.

And a big homage to 80's entertainment.The jokes are the kind you see in raunchy 1980’s movies - and THAT is the overarching joke of the whole film: it’s a subtle parody of the whole STYLE of 80’s entertainment that we all actually took seriously at the time. That subtext is what upgrades all the funny scenes into hilarious ones.It does a great job using visuals and music to poke fun at itself. The slow motion action and cheesy music are great. All those greenscreen backgrounds add to the campy feel.Just the fact that these guys are crime-fighting lifeguards is hilarious. The Rock and Efron are a great pair.  Efron is on the rise, maybe a future star. He's been smart to pair up with the Rock and Deniro in his last two movies.There are some great bits in this movie - long funny scenes like the one in the morgue and the ""stuck junk"" scene.

He has no kid unlike the 90s TV show, but is dedicated to the Bay, saving lives and making friends on the daily.New life guards come in including bad boy Brody played by Zac ""8 Pack"" Efron. They discover a vivacious Latina is smuggling drugs through the bay, and take the law into their own hands due to police disinterest/incompetence.The film almost is like Baywatch Nights, the first season, with its dark crime story. But there are plenty of laughs, dicks, giggling chests, raunchy language and jokes.Audiences would like more characters/actors from the TV show. All we get is David Hasselhoff in a brief cameo (and a 2nd in the credits) and a super slow mo and hot Pamela Anderson at the end. She doesn't even speak, but if there's a sequel it's set up to include her in the story.The tone isn't very 90s TV Baywatch. It's typical Zac Efron R rated comedy 2010s. But that's OK. It's got heart and funny moments. It's not bad like Chips, Miami Vice, or any other of the stupid Hollywood remakes.Special features include 11 minutes of trailers, 3 featurettes with cast and crew on the characters/actors, remaking the classic world famous TV show, and the stunts and physical acumen of Dwayne Johnson & Zac Efron in particular. Also, 10 minutes of deleted scenes. The blu ray has an extended cut with 5 minutes of additional and changed scenes. In some cases the theatrical version has more to a scene. The additional 5 minutes doesn't have anything that would qualify as unrated. Just slightly changed.","4.0 "

I will say that most of the humor is oriented to guys but overall everyone should find something from it to enjoy. Zac Efron and The Rock do a good job of creating a rivalry early on which incites most of the humor but from start to finish it's great.

"Baywatch","Baywatchable","PennWriter","Coming from someone who never watched ""Baywatch"", this was . . . . okay. I didn't think it was really all that funny, but it wasn't necessarily bad. It's mostly just dumb, light-hearted action with some crude humor, sexy girls/hunks in swimsuits, admittedly gorgeous cinematography and the most amusingly obnoxious title card ever. I usually enjoy the Rock, Zac Efron didn't annoy me as much as I was thinking he would, Alexandra Daddario and Kelly Rorbach are a feast for the eyes, and overall it wasn't nearly the cringe-worthy mess I usually expect from modern comedies. If it's not obvious already, this isn't a movie to turn to for strong characters, memorable storytelling or even a good action romp. It's just a watchable, fun-but-not-funny beach flick with plenty of Dwayne Johnson, some nice visuals, and its own fair share of hot girls in bathing suits running in slow motion.","3.0 "

"Baywatch","Part Action, Part Comedy:  All Good.","Michael A.","I've probably only seen a few of TV episodes back when that was on.  The film does a great job of not taking itself too seriously.  It's a fun mix of comedy and action that really reminds me of the first (and maaaybe 2nd) Beverly Hills Cop movies, as far as how well it switches between the two genres.  One minute it's goofy; the next, it's serious action/drama.  In words, this dichotomy sounds like it would be too much of a contrast to work.  Nonetheless, the flow from scene to scene is smooth, with the movie never forgetting to not take itself too seriously while dishing out fun action scenes.Based on the previews (and my prior ""meh"" attitude towards the series), I wasn't expecting much.  So, I was very surprised when I caught myself laughing out loud within the first five minutes.  I know it was within the first five minutes because, as surprised as I was, I stopped the movie to check the run time.The cast all did a pretty good job and were well cast for their roles. Priyanka Chopra plays a good ""badguy"". The Rock (I'm sorry, but why have removed that moniker from his name?), clearly has a fun time with The Hoff's namesake protagonist character.  He also is really adept at the action/comedy style that Eddie Murphy was so great at.  This is why it brought back a good-ole-days feeling of watching Beverly Hills Cop.And, just as with Taggart and Foley, The Rock and Zack Effron have good chemistry in the role of enemies who must come to terms with each other to fight the badguy.  The ladies hold true to the original series (somewhat derisive) name: Babewatch.  However, besides being nice screen candy, they also bring life and depth to their characters.  Kelly Rohrbach  (the blonde), in particular, does a great job of looking like the ditzy slow-mo camera'd blonde and then contrasting that with both good portrayal of emotion as well as strength.Then there's poor Ronnie Greenbaum, who plays the ""not quite of the beach mold"" character.  But, again, he does a great job of both enjoying the fun of being the misfit when the movie is in comedy mode, as well as switching to can-do teammate when the movie is in action mode.Remember, the movie has fun with itself and all of the cast do a great job of moving back and forth between action and comedy.  No, it's not a serious crime drama.  No, it's not the funniest movie you've ever seen.  Yes, it does make an hour and a half pass quickly and enjoyably with some good laughs and fun action scenes.If you're like me and weren't a fan of the series, don't skip this (as I almost did) based just on the title.  If you were a fan of the series, The Rock does a good job of bringing a crime-fighting, bay-saving Mitch Buchannon to the movie format.  But, from the previews, you should know this movie isn't the serious drama style that the series was.Oh ya, and the actual ""Hoff"" does make a brief cameo (in a truly Luke and Obi-wan moment, no less).  So, if you're one of his die hard fans, you'll want to watch it for that scene.","5.0 "

It's packed with lots of corny one-liners, jabs between characters, and full of laughs. It's not for people who are looking for a mature comedy, it's man-parts jokes and slapstick comedy and for people who don't take themselves too seriously.

There were some funny parts but just not enough and seems like I've seen it before. Looks like they spent the most money paying The Rock. Some of the CGI was Sharknado like quality.

Of every 10 jokes, 9 fall flat, and unfortunately there were only about 10 that seemed like jokes in the whole film.  I somehow managed to never really watch the series in the '90s and can't help but feel grateful for that now.  The cast is not without effort (except for a dismal F-bomb-spraying Priyanka Chopra), and kudos to David Hasselhoff for appearing shirtless at his age, in a cameo (Pam Anderson has a cameo, too), but it all becomes noticeably painful at a nearly 2-hour run time.  And whatever credibility Zac Efron has received from critics in recent dramas may now go out the window.  I'm also trying to figure our why, per the credits, it was filmed on Kodak Motion Picture Film.  Really? Why would someone want to preserve this?","2.0 "

Guys are barely shirtless, girls are barely naked. It doesn't make you laugh, it does not turn you on. Useless movie ever. Most of the actors are even more terrible than the original series. The plot is super bad. Only Zac Efron gets an ""interesting"" character. He only gets cast for that type of ""nice loser"", so he gets better.

Chopra just looks way to hot to be seen as a bad girl/guy ever!!! Even when she did Quantico which I enjoyed she did good playing for the good guys. A hot chick that didn't even want to touch the sand standing on a footstool just didn't fly with me. CJ did a great job because she always looked seductive but, still kept a some what professional standpoint to aid new recruit Ronnie who was a serious weak link to the team. The movie focused to much attention on him and could have had some younger stud to fill his place. Just can't ever see a geeky nerd who is clearly not in shape to run ever being a lifeguard or beating out the competition vs all the other in shape contestants trying out. But, I'm sure it was a dream come true for him being around the hot ladies!!! Summer is just drop dead gorgeous. Her acting isn't as strong as CJ but, you can see growth to where she could eventually be a headline star at some point in her career. Stephanie seemed more like a filler piece to the team and she should have been replaced with chopra on the team it would have sparked more marketing and sales for sure!!!","4.0 "

"Baywatch","Warning......PLEASE READ BEFORE SPENDING.......!","Cody Jones","By far the worst movie Dwayne Johnson(The Rock) has ever been in. The Acting was horrible, the ""comedy"" was extremely CHEESY AT BEST and the entire plot(yes it has one) was equal to that of a Scooby-Doo episode. I understand it was meant to be a little cheesy, but it was horribly done and had to be thought through & written in it's entirety over somebodies 30 minute lunch break.As for the Actors/Actresses you get the feel like it was like their first time acting. Alexandra Daddario looked like someone had taped her eyes wide open the whole time while Zac Efron seemed to act his part as though he knew it was bad and said ""the script is horrible, oh well i'm getting paid"". Dwayne Johnson did a decent job acting his role, he probably knew it was trash but made sure he put his all into what was given to him. The other  not so well known actors/actresses followed suit with the Rock.I also want to add that not only the vibe but the whole image of the movie is like the wet dream of an insecure, out of shape, recluse, super high & introverted wacko's perspective of what occurs beyond his/her front door and what people who are good looking and athletic do and act like when they go to the beach.I can only assume that if you found this movie to be seriously good, well done and funny or any combination of those words then you really have got to open your mind if you even have one.What a waste, in every sense of the word and its meaning.","2.0 "

"Baywatch","Baywatch quick movie review","J. Daniel Spratlin","What’s it about?Mitch Buchanan (Dwayne Johnson) is the ultimate boy scout of lifeguards. But when illegal drugs threaten the sanctity of his bay, he and his team take it upon themselves to expose the criminal plot.What did I think?I really wanted to like this one. I used to love watching the cheesy 90s original and I even appreciate the genial charms of Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. But by the mid-way mark, I was ready to raise an arm and call for somebody to ‘saaaaaaaaaaave me’ (*cue theme song*).Despite a few laughs and a LOT of gratuitous (but equal opportunity!) body shots, Baywatch suffers a MAJOR identity crisis that causes a lack of cohesion. Is it a re-boot? A parody of the original? Or an awkward continuation of the original Baywatch universe, where the ‘new class’ of lifeguards have the exact same names as their predecessors for some bizarre reason? Good luck trying to figure it out, because I doubt anyone involved with the movie has yet.","3.0 "

While it's not exactly dumb & dumber, it certainly was a waste of everyone's talent. Why did Zach Ephron go to the trouble to work out for this ? Pretty much what you have is a Flexy, jiggly farce of a movie that threw in some very serious moments in an effort to make this seem like a legitimate movie.What ruins the movie is that every other word is : F---  and there is almost 4 minutes ( it seemed like more) of a man not being able to separate himself from a slatted wood beach lounge chair. The supposed joke is that his reaction to a woman he has a crush on is extreme. Apparently she's impressed with his ""reaction"" & the size of him ""manhood"",cause later he literally gets the girl. You're going to have to drink alot in order to find this movie funny. Embarrassing to watch, embarrassing to admit I rented it, such a waste.","1.0 "
"Baywatch","A lame resurrection of an old TV favorite","M. Oleson","Well, I knew what I was getting myself in for, so I can’t be too smug about this reimagined popular TV series that ran from 1989 to 2001.  The biggest problem is that the film seems to swing too far in the direction of an earnest “police” drama then back to the campy silliness that was most likely the target.  The writers even go so far as to bring up the absurdity of a lifeguard doing police undercover work, but they do it anyway.Speaking of the writers (there are 5!) they get a couple things right.  Mitch (Dwayne Johnson) use of various TV, musical groups and movie names he calls the Ryan Lochte-like Olympic swimmer Matt Brody (a ripped Zac Efron).  Names like “One Direction” and “High School Musical.”  Brody says to Mitch, he’ll correct the error of his ways, if Mitch will call him by his real name.  Think that will ever happen?  The other scene which is pretty funny is when Brody and Mitch break into the morgue to check out the cause of death of a councilman (Oscar Nunez).  Mitch directs Brody to check the area between the ball sack and the anus for signs of foul play.It is one of two scenes of nudity in the film.  The other is the backside of the one actor you would just as soon keep his pants on.  But let’s face it, most people are going to watch this film for the physical appearance of the actors in very brief bathing suits.  That is a success.  The three females (Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach and Ilfenesh Hadera) are perfect specimens of the gender.  Toss in Priyanka Chopra as the bad girl and you have a pretty picture.  And that is complemented by Efron and “The Rock.”The guy with the bare butt scene is poor Jon Bass who plays the other lifeguard who made the team based on his determination says Mitch.  Johnson is always fun to watch and his chemistry with Efron is very good.  The acting?  Well, hopefully everyone got paid.  The script and the editing is very poor.  There are several scenes that go back and forth between camera angles and the people aren’t even in the same position.  The jiggle factor is high, so there is that.  Bikinis galore and everyone on the beach looks good in them.  Otherwise this is a pretty lame resurrection of an old favorite.","2.0 "
"Baywatch","So good!","M. Gariti","Reading most of the one-star reviews, I see that many people missed the entire point of this movie.  They went in expecting a dramatic story of sorts, somehow continued thinking that it was supposed to be a dramatic movie despite the over-emphasized acting, and continue to this very day to insist that this is a failed recreation of the show ""Baywatch.""  Let me inform them, and those going in, of the truth:Most people already get this, but for those who don't, let it be known: THIS IS A SPOOF!  The reason the acting looks over-dramatic and forced is because it's supposed to!  I literally fell out of my chair laughing when I read a review saying that, ""The Rock and Zac Effron's acting is usually so much better than this, but here it's just pathetic!,"" thinking that it was just a mock review made to show how well they each did of making fun of themselves; then was horrified to read on and see that they were absolutely serious.  There are numerous things in the movie which have me absolutely befuddled as to how you could watch them and not automatically realize this is pure comedy.  I'll just point out one that doesn't really give anything away: Pamala Anderson is actually in the movie, and like the show, is always running in slow motion.  Only everything else isn't in slow motion, just her.  A boy nearly drowns, and at first the other lifeguards aren't concerned because Pam is like, less than 20 feet away from him.  However, time passes, and as they look back, she's only like a foot or two closer.  The other lifeguards spring into action (from the lifeguard tower clear across the beach), swim out to him and retrieve him, lay him on the beach, perform CPR, (I honestly can't remember if they can rescussitate him or not), an ambulance comes, the lifeguards explain what happened to paramedics, and the boy's put on a stretcher an taken to the hospital.  As the ambulance pulls away, Anderson arrives, and says, ""Is he okay?  Was I too late?""  To which the lifeguards respond, ""No, don't worry.  We couldn't do this without you!""This is one of the best comedies out there, but the most important thing to remember?  It IS a comedy!","5.0 "

"Baywatch","""..DUMB ONE WATCH ACTION COMEDY..""","SDX","PLOT...Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron team up and go way beyond the call of duty in this wild and outrageous action-packed comedy. When a dangerous crime wave hits the beach, legendary Lt. Mitch Buchannon (Johnson) leads his elite squad of badass lifeguards on a mission to prove you don’t have to wear a badge to save the bay. Joined by a trio of hot-shot recruits including former Olympian Matt Brody (Efron), they’ll ditch the surf and go deep undercover to take down a ruthless businesswoman (Priyanka Chopra) whose devious plans threaten the future of the bay.This is a pointless movie to be made in the first place, they basically have turned Baywatch into a lame comedy movie full of dick and boob gags that have been done a million times before, the cast is very wasted here, Dwayne Johnson is a great action star but falls flat on his face in this movie, Alexandra Daddario is a great actress and is wasted too, but she does look amazing in a swimsuit (most redeeming feature of the movie) the story is utter rubbish from beginning to end, childish, Zac Efron fits right in I guess! the CGI effects are terrible, the movie is maybe worth a rent for a few giggles and lovely ladies in swimsuits otherwise don't waste money, a watch once movie!!","3.0 "

A Good Script,fun banter,good Acting for what this is and larger than life Action. I found Jon Bass is the best part of this ,he is underdog and routing for him the whole time!  If they didn't script him in and give him a big part of the role..I don't think I would like the movie as much, The music was a dubstep paradise and that might age the movie more then actors of the time. The cons, the main bad guy wasn't so defined as she could have been,she was more of a background villain, Zack role could have been a little more down in his luck and regaining ..they did that slightly..but kinda got lost in action to action seq. The rock always has a line with heart..maybe it is part of the contract he has. But he put in there about Ronny always trying and that got him in..that is a good message of today! maybe that could be push ""a little more in the script"" ..The female roles were strong..and they could have more saving life  time and showed off more of there skills..but still even with out doing that..it is very much rewatch-able.","5.0 "

"Baywatch","Could Have Had More Beach Time But if You Were a Fan of the 90's TV Show, It's Worth Checking Out.  A Lot of Crude Humour Though","James N Simpson","I loved the first part of the movie when most of it revolved around being on the beach, but got a bit over the away from the beach storyline which wasn't that impressive that dominates the second half or so of the film.  I thought the initial half of the film captured the cheesiness and over the topness of the TV show.  I loved how everyone kept pointing out, but you're not a cop Mitch!  It was interesting that Johnson's movie daughter (Alexandra Daddario) from the film San Andreas played Summer in this movie.  Zac Efron played the Olympic superstar celebrity brat well, he had some good vocal clashes with Mitch early on.  I would have liked to have seen more cameos from the original TV show cast in this one.  If you used to watch the TV show in the 90's this is well worth checking out.  Has a lot more crude humour than the original, as well as language. If you don't like those things this might not be the movie for you.","4.0 "

The rating should probably be 4/5, but I'm giving it 5 stars to celebrate the beefcake over boobs....for once!!!  Big kudos for the two leads.  Very underrated film, and this is from someone who hates almost all new mainstream movies these days in the terrible era of ""Cars 3"", ""Despicable Me"" garbage, ""Emojis Movie"", etc.  I assumed this was more of the same crap, but harken back more to classics like ""Airplane"".

The sophomoric sexually oriented sight gags and constant profanity are deserving of an XXX rating..  or perhaps a new one NW for not fit for anyone who is either terribly immature or doesn't smoke weed. This movie typifies what is wrong with the Movie and television today as a corrupting influencer on the younger generation. Obviously promoting the alcohol and drug cult that is ruining so many lives today.  I did not order this movie but someone in my household did, hopefully unaware of its content, or I would ask for the money back..","1.0 "
"Baywatch","That ridiculous dance scene...","Matt","alone eliminates 3 stars. When I watch scenes like this, its amazing to think that someone actually thought it was funny when deciding what to put in the movie.Probably the only thing that keeps this from being One Star are the funny names Johnson calls Efron, and Alexandra Daddario, who I could look at all day long.","2.0 "
"Baywatch","Comic Gold","Missy","I thought this movie was FANTASTIC!  The humor was on point, Dwayne Johnson shows his comic chops (almost more so than he did in Central Intelligence).  Zac Efron was also very comedic.  Some of his lines were comic gold.  But what set it apart to me from other beach themed movies and TV shows, there was eye candy for men and women.  Definitely worth the 2 trips to the theater to see it (yes I enjoyed it that much).","5.0 "

It’s sad when I wanted to block out one actor for how stupid he was when I had no problem with the other guy that got his junk struck in a lounge chair!

Even as a spoof comedy, this horrid film was enough to demand your purchase price back.The film mostly consists of meatheads cracking d*ck jokes, spoofing the tv series.  But now we have the misfortune of experiencing an extra five minutes in 4K UHD definition to obliterate the rest of our remaining senses entirely.YAY!!!  But seriously.  If Zac Efron, David Hasselhoff and an aging Pamela Anderson are in the credits, that should be enough repellant to keep most away.

This movie does a great job poking fun at the original series, but it still embodies the best parts of what it so great.  The jokes are funny, the actors and actresses are fun to watch and the essence of the Baywatch series is captured really well.. even the slow motion running.  If this isn't your type of movie then please don't watch it! It clearly isn't your cup of tea and there is no point for you to watch it and then blast it online... this movie wasn't meant for you as their target audience.

All these so-called character-driven dramas that get high critical acclaim are actually very boring. I cannot sit through them. Viewers should not just go by what the critics say. In 1980 Kramer vs. Kramer won best picture, which is the same year The Empire Strikes Back was released, go figure. Empire was savaged by the critics. I'm not saying that this movie compares to Empire, but there are many movies that the critics hated that I liked, this film being one of them. This movie was entertaining, funny, and visually stunning (Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach) cough! cough! The scene in the morgue was probably unnecessary, but despite that it was a lot of fun!

Also when CJ walks away we like to see it, but unlike the tv show it usually cuts away. Finally the R-rating is for violence, male nudity, and language.. all are fine but something is blatantly missing there if it's going to be R???

If I could compare it to anything, it might be the last two Charlie's Angels films - pretty people moving the story along ( I liked those pictures too ).Top-lined Johnson and Efron are at their screen pleasing best, with enough charisma-glue to keep the whole thing together. Main and supporting cast play this with a wink and a grin, it is BAYWATCH after all. Great as a feel-good movie, or as a gift.  Goofy fun, which is what we need, sometimes.

I was a huge Baywatch fan and I own all 11 seasons in dvd and I watch the show every summer vacations. after the negative reviews I read I went to watch the film expecting the worst especially after I watched that HORRIBLE TRAILER. Fortunately the movie was a nice surprise. those fools gathered the worst scenes of the movie and made that auful trailer. fortunately the bad scenes were not the majority of the movie.  maybe the only real issue I had was the confusion of the new mitch and the new c.j parker since david and pamela were also shown in the movie and even we had a scene in which DAVID ASKS DUANE HOW HE WAS GIVEN THE ROLE WHEN HE (david) WAS THE REAL MITCH FOR NEARLY.....20 YEARS........LOL  ?

He enters a time he calls The Great Sadness and wonders where God was when his daughter was taken and why would He allow such a thing to happen. Mack receives a mysterious note from Papa, the name his wife uses for God, asking him to meet Him at the shack deep in the wilderness of Oregon. After much deliberation, Mack heads there and embarks on the most soul-searching, trans-formative spiritual journey he has ever experienced. In addition to Sam Worthington, some other notable actors and actresses in this movie include Octavia Spencer who plays Papa and Tim McGraw who plays Mack's best friend, Willie.This movie is approximately 132 minutes long and is rated PG-13 for thematic material including some violence. It can be watched in English and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital Audio, English Descriptive Audio, Spanish Subtitles, and English SDH.I had already read the book when I watched this movie last night and I cried when reading it so I knew it would make me emotional but I didn't expect to cry during almost the entire movie. The Shack is definitely one of those movies that left me emotionally-satisfied and, if you are a crier, I would definitely grab a box of tissues before watching this. I thought the acting was phenomenal and I loved how beautifully this movie was done. I feel it followed the book pretty closely so if you are mostly interested in watching the movie instead of reading the book, I think you will still be able to really enjoy it. I'm glad I read the book first so I knew what to expect and it was nice to see how the movie was done, as opposed to how I pictured it in my mind.If you've read the book and loved it, I highly recommend watching the movie. It's not scary necessarily and the violent acts aren't shown. Most of the violence is hinted at based on our knowledge of the subject (a child abduction) but there are a few things shown after everything's happened. Those parts were hard to watch but the rest of the movie was so good that I will definitely watch it again. I have a friend who is eager to see this as well since we both loved the book!","5.0 "
"The Shack","Deeply Moving!","Wendy in Ohio","A very moving movie. Much pause for reflection as the viewer takes time to consider what is happening. I have read the book ""The Shack"".  The screenplay was well done. Sam Worthington's performance was outstanding. Tim McGraw is a supporting actor. I would recommend this. If anyone has lost a child it could be therapeutic. The event that caused the loss of the child in the movie was horrendous. There is, as I mentioned previously, some deep reflection going to naturally happen during the viewing.","5.0 "

"The Shack","Concentrate on the Message","S_Allen","Let me set the stage a bit. The Case for Christ was getting ready to be released and I heard some women in my theology class talking about the Shack. Shortly after this, I saw a trailer. I was a bit put off thinking Octavia Spencer might be representing God.. hopefully not. I decided not to see it at the theater and instead read the book.The book helped me get past the God as a woman with its explanation for it but some of the things in the book were hard for me to visualize. I liked the book though and had no trouble finishing it. then I preordered the movie.This movie is a GOOD thing. I don't understand why people are trying to make it bad. If more Christians operated on the basis of love, forgiveness and trusting God to be the judge there would be... wait for it more Christians. Call me crazy but I'm pretty sure God would approve.I've started reading this piece called ""The Shack -- the Missing art of evangelical discernment"" thanks to a commenter. I have a lot to read still but one thing I have noticed is that the writer doesn't seem to get the concept of the trinity saying that the Father and the Holy Spirit weren't suffering with JKesus on the Cross. That is like saying Jesus wasn't there at creation when the bible clearly states he was John 1:1, 14. The trinity is very hard to wrap our heads around but the movie did a good job representing it when Mack asked: ""Whch one of you is...""  The answer says it all.Watch it if you love God, watch it if you don't believe in God but aren't so opposed to God you can't stand any references to it. Watch it if you have a semi-open mind. The message in this movie is something the world needs so much more of and though I am a professing active Christian I'm not referring to the believing in Christ part.I thought this was a beautiful movie wonderfully acted and it almost brought my stoic husband to tears. I am so sad to see so many Christans not supporting something that could be so helpful to the faith if they just practiced the Biblical principals of love and forgiveness this movie does so well at conveying.","5.0 "
"The Shack","God's love endures, even when we don't...","Chris M W","This movie will meet you at whatever level of walk you have with the Lord.  The funny thing is, I felt conviction, but never condemnation.  This movie is about a never ending love and forgiveness, not only for others, but for yourself.  I, like many others can identify with the raw pain and the depth of emotion it uncovers, the pain we burry under the guise of being able to exist and cope. But what if we didn't burry it, what if we brought it to God?  Even the most ugly parts that we hide, the parts we don't want anyone else to see, the parts that scare us, the parts we feel are unforgivable? I understand some will see this as ""this move condones any type of behavior as long as you say I'm sorry in the end"" and truly if that is what you get out of it, you have completely missed the point.  When the judgment seat scene was on, it made take a look at myself.  How many times have I placed myself in ""on the Throne""?  How many people have I hurt through words or deeds?  God wants a relationship, not religion, He is there in the darkness, giving light to our footsteps, even when we don't see Him.  This movie reminded me of Romans 8:28.","5.0 "
"The Shack","Took me by suprise","Tim Isenhour","You need to watch this movie several times to get the complete story.This depicts each and everyone of us at one point in our lives.  As with my life, there have been times of sorrow, great happiness, and then sorrow again; just to be restored by happiness.  I hope this makes sense.I often question God and why things happened but eventually I see the big picture of ""it all"" and things just simply fall into place.I personally don't think it's wrong to question God, as I think it brings us closer.  Where most go wrong is when they deny God when life doesn't go according to ""their"" plans.","5.0 "

It's worth watching and better with a friend.","5.0 "
"The Shack","Awesome","Angela W","BEST MOVIE!!!  I cannot say enough about it.  I saw a Super Soul Sunday (Oprah) with the author.  Very interesting:This is his story - in his own words!The book I’ve written, The Shack, has proved to be hugely successful in ways that I couldn’t possibly have imagined.But the phone call that got it all started was something that threw my ordered world–what I desperately wanted people to believe was ordered–into pain and chaos long before I ever put pen to paper.I was an insurance agent, supporting my wife, Kim, and our six kids, the picture-perfect husband and provider. Framed family photos on the desk, the kids stretching from ages one to 14.I took them on camping trips up the Columbia Gorge and told them bedtime stories. I wanted to give them the safe, secure childhood I’d never had and never talked about.But the terror of my past was rarely far beneath the surface, no matter how hard I tried to hide it. I was always running from half-buried memories, haunted by doubts, doubts that said if anyone really knew who I was deep inside, no one could possibly love that damaged and frightened person.January 4, 1994, one phone call changed everything. I was just finishing lunch with a friend and Kim was on the line. “Hi, darling,” I said, waiting to hear some detail about the kids’ soccer games or a meeting with a teacher or a question about dinner–was I going to be home late again?“I’m here in your office,” she said, her voice like cold steel, “and I’m waiting for you.”“What’s wrong?”“I know.” Then she hung up. The air was sucked out of the room. I wanted to keep maintaining the fiction of our perfect marriage because it was all I really had in life.I wanted to hide, because hiding and lying were what I knew how to do best. I could appear to be the model Christian dad. I was the son of missionary parents, a Bible school graduate, a former seminary student.Kim and I had actually met at a church when I had a staff position in charge of the college youth group. She walked into a Friday evening meeting with two of her sisters. One look at her raven hair and dark searching eyes and I changed what I had planned.“Why don’t we split up into groups of two and pray for each other?” I said. Of course, I paired myself with Kim.She knows, I thought now. I wanted to run away, but that would solve nothing. You can’t run from your own sorry self.The next thought was ending my life, the ultimate form of self-centered running away.Perhaps it was a nudge of grace, but I finally decided I had to face Kim, even if the anger in her voice terrified me.All the secrets had to come out, all those things that had happened to me so long ago yet still seemed so much a part of the present, my behaviors and addictions I could never talk about. It was all or nothing.The trip to the office was one of the longest of my life. I pulled into the parking lot and slunk out of the car. I pushed open the door.The place was a shambles. Files thrown on the floor, drawers open, paperclips and pens dumped on the carpet, the trash can knocked over, memos ripped off my bulletin board.In the middle of it all sat Kim at my computer. She knew I was having an affair with one of her best friends. All the e-mails between us were there for anyone to find. Was I secretly hoping to get caught? The guilty, they say, seek punishment.“How could you? How could you betray me like this?” Kim shouted.I couldn’t meet her scorching gaze. I couldn’t bear seeing the pain in those dark eyes. Pathetically, I promised that I would end it right away, that I’d never let it happen again.“Why should I believe you?”Why indeed? I didn’t even trust myself. I was in no position to promise anything. But I did make one pledge: “I don’t want to be like this, Kim. I love you. I’ll do anything to keep you.""I’ll find the best counselor I can and work with him. I want to change, and there’s so much I need to tell you. Secrets have been killing me my whole life and if we are going to do this, I can’t have any more secrets.”After hours of intense interrogation, laced with fury and grief, Kim was done. “I will never believe another thing that comes out of your mouth the rest of your life,” she declared. I reached out to hug her, just touch her and hold on, but she stood up and pushed her way past, slamming the door in tears.And there I was, left to myself and the mess in my office, the mess in my life. The mess that was inside me. All my life I’d heard people say God loved us–that God loved me–but I’d never really believed it. How could I? I didn’t love myself. What could God love about me, especially now?Over the next three days I tried to talk to Kim. Why not tell her the truth? But she didn’t want to hear it. I was terrified I’d lost her already.In desperation I started seeing a therapist, two to three times a week. For the first time I asked another human being to enter into my life and help me heal. It was the first I’d told anyone what had happened to me as a boy growing up in New Guinea.My parents were missionaries to a primitive people and in those days missionary children were only allowed to be with their parents until they reached school age. At six I was sent to a boarding school.Sexual abuse that had already been occurring at the hands of the tribe since I was four now continued at the missionary school. I was terrorized, brutalized, dehumanized.The deep examination of what I had undergone nauseated me. Shame had become the very air I breathed, just another word for self-hatred. But if I were to change, if I were to heal, I would have to face the worst.It didn’t excuse my ugly behavior–nothing did–but it helped me to understand the duplicity, the fear, the loneliness–all the defense mechanisms that protected me as an abused child but were destroying me as an adult. I needed to get honest, with myself, with Kim, with God, with everyone.At night, at home, after the children had gone to bed, I would tell Kim what I had told the therapist: the horrible stuff I had been running away from for over 30 years. She would listen, but barely respond.My despair grew. I couldn’t heal her any more than I could heal myself. And night after night, I felt I was slowly losing myself–that if I kept up the truth-telling, there would be nothing of me left, the layers peeled back with nothing at the center.Where were the people who should have protected me as a child? Where was God? Didn’t anyone care at all? For the first time I allowed my anger to surface, and it began to consume me.One day I went to an old barn and found a pile of fallen wormy apples. I flung them against the barn, watching them smash and explode, until I had no rage left. There I sat, in a cascade of tears amid the pulp and the pungent, fermented odor of rotting apples. I couldn’t dredge up anything more.I couldn’t lie anymore. I was like the pulverized pulp on the ground, rotten to the core. I bent down and picked up a seed. If only I could hold on to some seed of hope, some sign that I would get better. “Are you there anymore?” I asked God. Am I? I wondered.Later I confessed to a family friend I had lost all hope. What I didn’t tell her was that I was planning to fly to Mexico and rent a room, buy enough prescription drugs to kill myself where my children would not discover my body. I was done, exhausted, finished. She said quietly, “Paul, there is a seed.”“A seed?” What did that mean? In my despair I could sense the answer: A seed can grow. If there was even one seed then something could grow.What God could do for a seed he could do for me. In one little seed all my hope came back. I never struggled with suicide again.Healing is a process, and that was the beginning. It took 11 years for me–and for Kim and me–11 years of hard emotional work building a whole new relationship based on trust, a trust I had learned that started with trusting God with all my pain, all my anger, all my secrets.I came to understand how God had never abandoned me. I spoke to him more frankly. I didn’t try to hide anymore. The conversations with Kim stretched into some long talks about how God had reached me when I had completely bottomed out.Then one day she said, “Why don’t you write down what you’ve learned as a gift for the kids?”I wrote on a pad of paper as I was commuting to and from work, telling the story of a man who met God when he thought he’d lost everything.Those pages turned into a novel, The Shack, that I photocopied at Office Depot and passed along to family and friends, and then it all got out of hand. Before I knew what had happened, I was a best-selling author. But that’s not why I wrote the book.The book is true, just not real, like a parable. I may not be exactly like the fictional main character, but what that man learns about the healing power of love and forgiveness, the liberation of the soul through transparency and grace, is a journey I know well.","5.0 "

"The Shack","The Good News","MelloPi","After I read the book 4 or 5 years ago, I hoped that this would someday be made into a movie so that the message of forgiveness, redemption, and His love so deep and awesome could be shared with millions more. (Too few people read a good book or The Good Book anymore.)  When I heard the movie had been made, I waited to see it so that I could first let go of a bias I had that made me assume the movie would not do the book justice.  Aside from a few details throughout the story, which the book went into more depth to develop and a couple a deviations in the movie compared to the book, the message of this story in both publications was spot-on the same.  I only wish the actor that played the Son looked more like how He was described in the book, which was taken from the description given to us in Isaiah 53:2, and not the handsome man that played Him in the movie.  I knew the Holy Spirit was going to be a challenging role to fill, given the book's description as One more ethereal and not of solid bodily form.  However, the movie did well to cast a shimmering light about the actress at times so I give it a pass.  As for the one that played God, there isn't an actress alive today that could have filled this role better or aligned more perfectly with how the book described Him.  The only major story line piece missing from the movie was when Mack (after his car accident at the end) directed authorities to the cave where they would find the remains of his daughter.  Watch the movie.  Read the book.  You will love them both.","5.0 "

"The Shack","Worth the time and cash","Charles E.","What an overwhelmingly beautiful piece or art.  It made me weep in several segments.  I wish the gods represented in the film were real and then I would like them and be on board with them  every time.  I was raised in a Baptist Church and went religiously (ha ha) up until I was in my 50s.  I have also been in the world and was a rougher than a cob Air Force Officer for 22 and a half years and then a civilian contractor to the air force another 18 and a half.  I am a whiskey drinker and cigar smoker.  For 20 years, at night, I was a college, then University History Professor and one evening I stopped in lecture and wondered if I believed what I was telling my students or did I believe what I heard on Sunday mornings.  I had always thought that it was all reconcilable and it may be meaning that 4.5 Billion years ago god or the gods said let there be light and then later said let their be evolution.  If he or she or they or it is really god then they do their own thing.  This movie is largely from the Christian perspective and I have always thought that it really was ""the greatest story ever told.""  I have wrestled with religion for the last 15 years and am convinced that if you are happy with what you believe then just leave it alone.  Study will only generate questions that cannot be answered.  The newest crazy thing are the ""Young Earthers"" who want people to believe that the world is less than 10,000 years old.  Which makes sense because humans have been only been writing a record for about 10,000 years and having and having and been saving  a record and evidence of  cultures.  I am not an atheist but I don't think anyone knows and maybe we are not supposed to know.  It would be very cool to have a or many supernatural entities that care about us and look after us to some extent.  In a graduate level history class Charles Shows told us a Confucius saying that works for me:  He who says he knows, knows not, because if he really knew then he would understand how much that we really don't know.  Good show but if you are all about Christianity and want it to be like it is in Sunday School since you were a child you may be pissed off but if you have a college education it is probably well worth your time.  May the Force be with you.  Chuck","5.0 "
"The Shack","One to share without fear.","Ross P. Hyland","So much better than your average ""Christian Movie Production"".... this is a proper movie and an excellent adaptation of the book. The minor changes between the book and the movie are necessary and good due to the different medium (Books vs Movies).This is a movie you could easily share with non believing friends without embarrassment. A couple of scenes such as singing round the campfire with the kids and the initial singing in church worried me a little as being somewhat twee and peachy keen corny...... but on reflection I decided they showed real people ...... particularly American Bible Belt people..... and they were a fair and real depiction. These scenes were only moments of the film anyway.Excellent film overall and one to share as I said earlier. The story God is telling is a far happier and more totally victorious one than our mean little imaginations and nasty little brochures would suggest.","5.0 "
"The Shack","Great Movie - But Doesn't Have All the Answers","The Veteran","This is a movie worth seeing, although the characters playing the Trinity come off as smarmy too often.  It tries, but does not really answer questions like, ""How can God let terrible things happen to innocent children?""  and ""Why does God seem so indifferent to our suffering?""  These are questions that have been around longer than the Book of Job, and that book does better than the movie in answering them.  Still, the movie has redeeming qualities in that it gets you to thinking about why God does what He does.  One of the takeaways from the movie:  forgiving doesn't mean that you are sanctioning an offense; it just means that you are letting go of it so it doesn't rule your life.  Different people will get different things from this movie.  I don't regret watching it!","3.0 "

So I went to the premiere with her for the sake of loving her and she wanted to go see it for date night. I decided to go with an open mind and allow God to speak to me in the movie. I got rocked so hard by God. I probably cried most of the movie. It was the best movie I had ever seen and the things I believe about God and his nature were perfectly portrayed in this movie. I couldn't stop vouching for how good this movie was after I had watched it. So if you are on the fence with this movie or are doubting the nature of God with how the author portrays God, go and ask God to reveal truth to you. He'll blow your mind.","5.0 "

"The Shack","When the Students Ready, The Master will Appear","It's Me A","I really enjoyed this movie and watch it sometimes when I just don't feel like I have anything else to watch.  This movie attempts to explain a mighty big topic in a short amount of time and on that note I feel like they did a good job getting across the basics.  My friend introduced me to this movie at a time that I was grieving the loss of my father.  Things had happened within the hospital that he was at that made me angry and I was holding a grudge even though at the end my father did get the treatment we had envisioned and passed away peacefully feeling no more pain.  But no matter how perfectly things had come together I still held on to the bitter experience where I felt some people should have been held accountable for their negligence.The movie is about forgiveness of oneself and others through the absolute unthinkable circumstance and gives me plausible explanations to mull over.  Is the movie perfect?  Surely not but its the best attempt I've seen so far that tackles such heavy, controversial topics in a comprehensive way.The heart of the storyline is simply love, healing, forgiveness based on faith in God. Overall, I liked the movie and would recommend to others that are struggling with these things and need a hand up.","5.0 "
"The Shack","Don'tcha Just Love Papa?","valkaraya","At first I thought this was going to be one of those ultra-Christian B Movies...knowing nothing about the book or the cast.  But, to my delight, it certainly is not either a B movie, nor dogmatic. Yes, it contains many references to mainstream Christian theology, but it also has just as many elements that suggest a very diverse spiritual approach to understanding God. What a great story, and told with such a high purpose that it transcends the story altogether.The cast is wonderful.  Sam Worthington (Pandora), Olivia Spencer (The Help, Hidden Figures), and narrator/best friend,Tim McGraw who delivers a surprisingly good performance. Papa is the story's nickname for God and is charmingly portrayed by both Spencer and later, changing disguises, more seriously by the great Graham Green. Tim McGraw and Faith Hill also co-wrote and performed one of the best movie songs I've heard in years.The film watcher may miss some of the dialogue which delivers the straight-to-the-point theology that drive the movie's messages--I turned on the English subtitles and it helped a lot.I've yet to read the book, but it will soon grace my kindle app. Because...this story is chock full of incredibly accurate true things about the way life and love actually work to our good.  Even through the blackest tragedies; maybe even because of the hardships we all encounter.There are a couple of slightly cheesy moments, that I ever so slightly cringed at during my first viewing (I watched it four times in two days), but in the end I came to love those scenes.I gave it an extra star for it's very accessible treatment of the importance of trust and forgiveness in real healing. The kind that heals the world.","5.0 "
"The Shack","Tremendous portrayal of God's immense love for us","Ian Acheson","This was an excellent rendition of the novel. I had tears in my eyes for most of the scenes set in the shack with the three persons of the trinity. The way the story depicts God's immense love for His creation is brilliant. Yes, at times a little preachy but I'm okay with it.I loved the 3 choices of actors for the Father, Son and Spirit. Fabulous. And the intensity of their connection and love for Mac was beautiful to watch. I kept saying to God, "" this is what I want, Lord; to live like this."" And crazy to think it's how He wants us to live with Him, always staying close and dependent on Him.The story does a great job exploring the mysteries of ""why does God allow suffering,"" the role evil plays in the world, the importance of forgiveness and our own susceptibility to being judges of right and wrong. All good reminders for me.I watched the DVD with a non-believer who found it a tad boring and I can understand that. As she said,"" there's a very specific market for this movie"" and as far as she was concerned she wasn't it. Which made me sad. However, I'm sure the Lord will use this story to convict many non-believers and be another link in the chain that draws them to Him.The scenery is gorgeous and the representation of the shack when God is present is beautiful. And there are laughs as well but I won't spoil it by mentioning the scenes.I'm sure I'll be watching it again soon.","5.0 "

The answer to many questions is filled with how well this movie was done.  As one grows in faith and continues to open their hearts and minds to the word of the Lord this movie is like another delicious entree of what will be if we continue to grow in Christ.  Is it heaven, man has no real idea but we can imagine as we are God's creation and as we continue to step forward away from the negative and ""choose"" to step forward the light gets brighter in our lives.  If you think about it, from infancy to death is a continual study and growth. Its which direction do you want to grow.  I have had my own personal tragedies that this movie helped me in a little way the understanding of letting go and trusting God.  It was rather freeing.  So in your journey take from it the lesson it teaches and yes like God has said because we are human it may take many times to let go, but he is always with us to encourage us, His hand is ever extended.","5.0 "

"The Shack","I was profoundly touched...","adventurebabbler","First, let me say that I read the book when it first hit store shelves. I loved it. However, I was reluctant to see the movie as I am mourning the death of my brother, and I was worried about my reaction to the movie. My brother in law came to visit and requested the movie for Family Movie Night.The movie stays decently close to the book, no Hollywood liberties. Some of the conversations are toned down a bit, but otherwise, it's pretty on point. I won't give anything away, but they don't do any specifics or gory details about the incident. My 11 year old watched it with us and there was nothing inappropriate.Have tissue, or a hand towel nearby, you will need it. I always told people about the book, and recommended it, but after my loss, I have learned that a book, or movie, of this nature touches everyone differently. All I can do is give my opinion and let you choose for yourself.","5.0 "

My expectations were high because I read the book three times but honestly as the movie progressed it just kept getting better and it pulled me into the story and message! This was one of the best inspirational movies I have seen.  I spent much of the movie moved to tears because it was so beautiful and it hit home with me on so many levels.  From the beautiful setting in Oregon...one of my homes to great acting... I just loved every part of this!  Tim McGraw was an added bonus and the song at the end written by Tim McGraw and Faith Hill was amazing!  I WAS NOT disappointed and it inspired and renewed my faith!

It does require a certain amount of introspection regarding what you believe and your faith.  As a born-again Christian, I felt it to be a very moving story because it put the main character into the position of being a judge (in a God like manner) and made him see that God does not discriminate or persecute according to a person's sins, but is the witness to the cause/effect of things gone wrong because of sin existing in this world.","5.0 "

I'm glad Paul Young was involved in the entire movie-making process and I thought the movie followed the book precisely. This was important to me as the book has made a significant difference in my life, it's a huge source of encouragement to me. I was delighted the scenes I found especially meaningful in the book were in the movie, they were the meeting in the cave with Wisdom and the Lights where Mack is reconciled with his Father. I would like to see that particular scene expanded on in the move, I thought it was cut a bit short and lost some of its continuity. The scenes about forgiveness brought me to tears in the theatre, it made a difference to hear and see these scenes.

But I was most pleasantly surprised.  In fact, I plan on buying this movie so that I can watch it whenever I want and however many times I want to.  It is a good story!  It is based on a true story!

From the perspective of a father, I think it would have a different impact than if others were to watch it. All around good production values, good acting from the major players, and a decently constructed story. It suffers sometimes from bouts of flat emotions, but this is partly due to Sam Worthington not showing his true range (he does in later parts of the movie). Additionally, it is preachy. Don't get me wrong, it's a good message, but I don't like films that overtly and actively try to convert you to their viewpoint (see the golden compass book series for a text example of this).. Some of the lines of thought are not fully fleshed out either, causing the point of a particular scene to fall flat - see the discussion of wrath. I think my favorite character is the one meant to represent Jesus - very honest and sincere, making me want to see more in hollywood films of the particular actor Avraham Aviv Alush.

The love of God is portrayed so accurately. Folks focus on the gender and miss the point. I believe God is a HE (as indicative of the bible); however, HE can manifest himself through various ways. Without telling the plot... Octavia Spencer as God the Father is a comforting African-American woman. The first scene shows Mac (the main character) living next door to her.

We were amazed at the quality of the show itself and how closely it followed the book (until the end).  However, had you not read the book, you wouldn't have noticed how the movie ending was different than the book. That being said, I believe that the viewer will get more from the film having read the book first.I have been told by my pastor, that this book is theologically wrong on so many levels, but he too enjoyed the book and the movie.

The movie can be watched without reading the book but it will take on a deeper meaning when you read the book.  Of course reading the Bible will also help to explore a relationship with the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.  People complain about how God is portrayed or that the story is not scriptural.

I saw it twice in the theater and rented it from Amazon. This may be the best depiction of God's heart I have ever seen.  And for those of you worried about God appearing in the form of a Black woman, you must have missed the fact that God reminded us that he takes on many forms (any form he wishes) in this instance God appeared as a Black woman who resembled the man's neighbor when he was a child.

I teared up and cried multiple times during the movie and it didn't feel like a tearjerker.  If felt real.  This is the movie we all need to see now.  Even if you don't believe in God, I think everyone could get something out of it.  I think it tries not to preach and leaves the question about 'whether it actually happened' and whether this vision of God is worth accepting, up to the viewer.I'm less concerned about the doctrine being correct.  If a person accepts this vision of God, then they would accept Jesus.  It is far more convincing than accepting Him because otherwise He'll send you to Hell.  People don't accept Jesus on doctrine, they decide based on how they feel.  I know I did.  Nowadays, who would read the doctrine?

"The Shack","Tissues Tissues Tissues","J. Pinter","The subject matter was too heavy for me, but uplifting in the end. I liked the Trinity embodied as a reference point for some who can't understand the concept.  It made me think. A lot.  Jesus was before The Beginning. It's His image and likeness we reflect, in God's image inside, and bodily, possibly the Son. ? Also I don't know how biblical this feeling is but somehow I can easily picture The Holy Spirit as being the template for woman, helpmate, brooding over her young, inspiring, whispering, guiding.","3.0 "

I read the book several years ago, and it did track fairly close to the book.  As a Dad, I did feel a lot of emotion when the Dad in the movie was going through what he had to go through.

"The Shack","Good and interesting story and take on the Trinity, just hard to understand  lead character sometimes","Mom-Wife-Youth Leader","I like the story, even though I have a hard time with the theology of some of it.  It's an interesting take on God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. If you can get past the theology issues, or if you don't particularly care about theology, it's good. Performances are fine, however the leading man is hard to hear quite often.  I found myself turning it up a lot, just to figure out it wasn't volume related, he just mumbles a lot.","4.0 "
"The Shack","Everyone should watch and expand their view","Wes Brockway","I had read the book and was less than enchanted with the story. The book is too wordy for me in all it's descriptions in my opinion. The movie does a fantastic job of depicting the meat of the story so that the meaning is caught but without a lot of laborious scenes. As such the movie moves steadily through the story keeping one's interest as the story unfolds. It does represent God in a different way than most people think but in my opinion it is not unbiblical or sacrilegious.","5.0 "

Remember it is a fiction book and not to be used in churches today to base their salvation on as I understand some are doing.  Just believe in Jesus Christ dying on a cross to pay for all our sins and accept that wonderful gift God has provided.  God has appeared in many forms..... such as a burning bush to Moses; a cloud in the wilderness; an angel to Abraham.  The Holy Spirit appeared as a dove when Jesus was baptised and on and on. He is what we need Him to be in our lives!  You need to read the book - it is much more  exciting than the movie.","5.0 "

"The Shack","The Shack was too fanciful for my taste.","NadieMax","I have to admit that I can be very critical of Christian-themed films. Yet, at the same time I have deep respect for Christian filmmakers. That being said, The Shack was too fanciful for my tastes. (Perhaps there is a Christian fantasy genre I am unaware of).  It was a bit of a muddle, however well-meaning. The attempt to anthropomorphize the Trinity was an overreach.  It was part New Age (God portrayed as an Indian Shaman) , God portrayed as a jiving (but pleasant enough) black lady. The Holy Spirit portrayed as an willowy and  enigmatic young Asia woman.  Jesus was almost believable. The filmmakers get several points for  Jesus being more realistically portrayedl as a young Jewish man.  There were some bits and pieces of political correctness scattered about the story.  I think the aspect of the film that I found most problematic was that there were elements of Gnosticism lurking about in the story. It had a more Gnostic feel to it much of the time and less of a Christian one.  Also, the power of grace and forgiveness was emphasized (which is fine), but nothing at all about the nature of sin and disobedience and its real consequences.  I much prefer Christian-themed films such as War Room which deals with spiritual issues in a vivid, real-world way. However, I will  balance out my criticism with something more positive. After my husband and I watched The Shack, his assessment was,  ""I really hope films like this help people in their lives and with their faith.""  I agree.","3.0 "

"The Shack","Few of those movies that's as good as the book","handy","I read the book many times. It's one of my fav book. First of all usually movie is never as good as book, and secondly Christian movie usually sucks (sorry). Christian movies are usually cliche and a joke to movie making. That's why I was sceptical to watch this movie. But I was thinking to give it a chance. And I pretty much cry through half of the movie just like when I read the book. The acting are very good by all the actor except the Asian woman for the Holy Spirit. She is not really capturing the role, in my mind she is older for some reason and more joyful. I think maybe the actress is not a Christian herself to understand Holy Spirit but also it is one of the harder role to play. Jesus was little disappointing too but the main actor is so good. He really displays all the emotions and I really love Octavia as God she is exactly how I imagined when I read the book. The scenery was also really beautiful. One another thing that make this movie so good is that it stay 100% true to the book. I hate when the movie changes the story when it adapt to the screen but this movie is spot on, really didn't change much. Over all an amazing and touching movie. I really enjoy it and hope people who are not Christian can enjoy it too but at the same time find comforting when they go through grieve.","5.0 "

"The Shack","Excellent Story, Not A Doctrinal Treatise","MizJones","We've read the book several times--it's a very helpful story for those who have experienced loss as well as those who enjoy inspiring, heart felt stories about grief, hope, despair, triumph, etc.  This movie stayed close to the book, only veering slightly while maintaining the story's integrity.But here's my big disclaimer:  Quit treating this as Bible doctrine.  It was never promoted as any kind of Christian doctrinal treatise on the nature of God or Jesus.  It's simply a story.  A good one, an inspiring one that encourages as well as challenges.  Nothing else.  Yes it's thought provoking (which is good) and yes there is plenty of artistic license involved.  So what?  Take what you want from it and leave the rest because this is fiction.  Christians get all excited and want to debate the nature of God after reading/seeing this story.  If it provokes people to get into their Bibles, then it's a good thing.  We could read about what God says about Himself for our entire lives and never come to a full understanding of Him, His son or His holy spirit.","5.0 "

"The Shack","A Frightening Glimpse into Ecumenical Christianity in the USA...","Ivan David Lippens","The Doctrine in this Movie is dangerously close to New Age Spiritualism, at times.There is a lot of great affirmation of Jesus Christ, but the characters of the Holy Ghost and the Father are WAY off, to the point where they are even depicted as feminine.There's a lot of feel-good nice-guy talk in this movie, but a lot of it is NOT Scriptural, according to God's Word.There are some Mechanisms that seem to be accurate, but there's a lot of muddy water in this film.When I heard about the book, years ago, I was shocked at the heresy I was exposed to, at the time.With this movie, it's more subtle, because of the constant niceties, but it's definitely still there.Anytime you put words into God's Mouth, you better watch yourself very carefully.If you are saying that God said something, you better be repeating it verbatim, or else you're a heretic, and that means a LIAR.There are a lot of lines, between the Trinity, that are just plain NOT Scripture.Above all else, THAT is the scariest thing about this movie.I would've given this film two stars, just for that reason, but I bumped it up a notch, because of the core message, which was that God is Good.I do think that is a really big problem for a lot of people.They really don't believe that God is Good, and they THINK they have a better idea of what truly IS good.For that reason, I do think that this movie could reach some folks who are embittered for those reasons.Otherwise, there is a huge lack of Scripture, and Logic, in attempting to provide answers to what many folks consider tough questions.All things considered, it's a MUCH more important watch than 99.99% of the other junk on the open market, and even though it's off in some important ways, it's still a worthy watch for most people out there.","3.0 "

"The Shack","the guy who plays Jesus is cute","Sara E. Davies","Yeah, I don't know. I haven't read the book, but ""The Shack"" strikes me as the type of novel that wouldn't translate well to film. There is only so much nuance that can be conveyed in a movie depicting an internal struggle. It would be challenging to stay true to the source, to capture a complex point of view, or to treat the subject matter with the same degree of depth. I was confused about who the narrator was supposed to be, and why that guy was telling the story instead of the main character. The theme is an attempt to address the question of why a god worth believing in would allow terrible things to happen to innocent people...and provides the usual god-moves-in-mysterious-ways answer, i.e. we're too small and self-focused to understand or appreciate the interdependent nature of events and relationships or the complexity of the universe. As is typical of such discussions, there are logical inconsistencies. Why create a world filled with pain in the first place? Why create sentient beings who are not smart enough to understand what's happening to them? Why does religion give all the power to ""god,"" while society places all responsibility on the individual? The best take-away is that ""god"" - however one chooses to define divinity - is within everyone. For someone with a secular perspective and no need to ask unanswerable questions, or who's given up asking questions about what is essentially unknowable, and can't help wondering why a team of multiracial gods is helping some random white dude, it's a nice enough story.","3.0 "

"The Shack","visually / conceptually stunning...but a failure","Michael T Bee","""The Shack""  is an interesting attempt at addressing suffering and evil but short on satisfying answers.Interesting in that it explores the idea in a visually stunning and creative way - disappointing in that it holds back on  answers -it fails to develop its ideas in a meaningful ways (acting seems almost dishonest in context of story).Justice is due but none can pay- some receive mercy others do not. Where is the standard and how is it applied? And...Why? Why? Why?Evil and suffering are _real enough_. I feel pain: personal and in those around me. I struggle for answers.""There are always consequences."" Best line to develop but again no follow through.Most disturbing visual element. The wounds of God appear as scars. I see them as fresh.Still gut punched by my own lossesbetter through meditation and prayer but still hurting. Would have enjoyed that ending because it tracks with my reality.I function out of mercy and compassion. I thank God for this. I found that spring within to be Christ. I function out of hope In Him. Sometimes the great sadness never leaves. For Christians as well as non-Christians.“If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially.""A Farewell to Arms Quotes by Ernest Hemingway - Goodreads","2.0 "

Things had built up inside me and I didn't realize what a effect they were having inside me. This movie had a great message..... ""Let it go"", and I have. Definitely bring whatever you feel appropriate to dry your tears; they'll flow. This movie explained, as my pastor said, ""the best way to show/explain the trinity"".

Suderman","If you are a Christian beware because the words in the book (That this movie is based on) doesn't speak the full truth of Jesus Christ, the one that is at the center of all creation and all authority. Other than that if you know the difference between fiction and truth it is entertaining. I guess you have to expect this kind of twisting from Hollywood from what they have done in the past to movies of faith and spirituality. If the story wasn't so fictional and was more biblical I would have given it 5 stars instead of 3. Some people out there that are Christian may even give it a 1 star or none at all but I see the world has many evils in it today. Many more than when I was a kid. It has become very cruel, hate filled, and divided. At least this story has a growth in a way to bring tears from sadness of things that happen to some people in real life that could possibly help them get comfort in some way.","3.0 "

"The Shack","Coulda been great, shoulda been straight to LifeTime..","Digited","Good acting (for the most part), great beginning to the story that just reals people in, and then it all gets lost in itself.  The story-line was almost intimidating in it's uniqueness but it took a dive half-way through.  It seems the writers just couldn't complete it without the tried-and-worn option of religion.  I won't mention any other spoilers besides that (so please put down the pitch-forks 'cause I'm not the first) but, I wasn't only yawning though the second half, I was making vocal and snide comments.  I expected so much more from this.  I wouldn't watch it again but I can't say I'd like my time back when I watched it for free to kill some time over the two evening it took to watch.","2.0 "

"The Shack","Solid Performances and Great For the Family","Julie","Very well acted and loyal to the overall theme of the book.  Even if you haven't read the book, the implication of how important it is to the health of one's soul and emotional wellness to forgive and let go of the anger of the past is presented in a way that should not offend anyone. I enjoyed how the story will allow the viewer to come to their own conclusion of what it may cost them to live a life that is more meaningful and without the guilt, anger and unforgiveness we tend to carry around. A little disappointed in Sam Worthington's Aussie accent showing through in several key scenes, which wouldn't have been a big deal if such care had not been taken in the beginning to establish the fact he was a midwesterner; this does not detract from the movie except to maybe lower the suspension of disbelief just a little. :)","5.0 "

"The Shack","Awesome story translated well to the screen","Just another opinion","Movie was amazing and most of the acting outstanding.  I was surprised by the drop in acting level however in two of the more minor characters ""Wisdom"" and the male Father God.  The movie's message, which is right from the book, is a great life lesson.  It's been years since reading the book, but it if I recall correctly they did a great job of adjusting some of the story line from the book (such as the discovery of the girl's body) to work better on screen.  80% of the movie is a 10.  It just drops a little with some of the supporting characters.  This is a movie worth re-watching a few times as we sort through the harder times of life.","4.0 "

That he/she is “especially fond” of us was so touching and reaffirming!

"The Shack","BEAUTIFULLY FILMED AND AMAZINGLY WELL-INTENTIONED ATTEMPT TO INSPIRE US ALL","Jack E. Levic","It's hard to find fault with a film that is so amazingly well-intentioned. THE SHACK is one of the most beautifully photographed films I have ever seen. The rich scenery and vibrant colors will send a burst of energy to your brain. Also, imagine the hope for the world if lovely and talented Octavia Spencer were God!THE SHACK is a story that tries to explain the unexplainable. Why do bad things happen to good people and why does God not intervene to stop the evil in the world?  Sam Worthington stars as Mack Phillips. He's happily married to a gorgeous and loving wife and has three perfect children.He has a childhood secret that haunts him but life as an adult is perfect until an unimaginable tragedy occurs to rock his world. It's here that the story sometimes veers off the believability path. God invites Mack to a secluded house in the mountains. God is in the form of Octavia Spencer and Jesus and the Holy Spirit are there for good measure. The Holy Trinity cook meals, do dishes and all sorts of domestic chores as they try to revive Mack's faith in God and mankind.It's a lovely attempt to give one man hope through his despair but it's hard to imagine why God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit reveal themselves to Mack. Yes, God is busy even when she (Octavia) seems to be relaxing. There must be billions of people to help at any given time. THE SHACK does go over the top at times and is a bit long. There is a blend of Scripture and stories from the Bible. Jesus does walk on water which adds some gentle humor. THE SHACK is a sweet movie that will inspire some and confuse others. It's amazingly beautiful to look at. It's a pleasant diversion from the average film but it may leave people with questions than answers.","4.0 "

"The Shack","and made the understanding of the love of God as Papa","Jonathan Blocher","I'm sure the other reviewers have covered all the salient features of this film, so I'll just add my personal impression.The book gave more detail, of course, and made the understanding of the love of God as Papa, Joshua, and Sarayu even more explicit. So if you like the movie, but haven't read the book, get and read it. You'll be glad you did.The movie also added a scene that is not in the book: the neighbor lady that served young Mac the cookies. That helped foreshadow other revelations, so it was a worthwhile addition, in my opinion.","5.0 "

"The Shack","It was okay.","Kindle Customer","It was fine,  but I didn't realize going in that it was about faith and a christian movie. Maybe if i had expected that then i would have enjoyed it more. I couldn't watch the whole thing cause it was boring to me and I am agnostic at the moment so it didn't capture me.  I will definitely give it to my Mom for Christmas.  She is a very devout Christian and would love it. I was very torn.  I would've given it a 1 star, but if I was a Christian and believed in the holy trinity then I would have definitely given it 5 stars.  So definitely depends on the audience.","3.0 "

"The Shack","Lots of truth. One foul up.","Christine H Leone","I read the book and it was excellent. The movie was ok. But I was disappointed in it. The woman who played God did not act that well. They should have put Morgan Freeman in as God if they wanted an African American.  He would have been great. This woman to me and many others I've spoken to was a poor pick. Awful. Other then that the movie was good. But nothing like the book. They could have done better. It did make me cry. Very emotional in some parts. Very much truth of a reality that exsists in us all.

I cried for nearly the entire time, it was not sad it was beautiful and raw and real. If you are worried about the ""theology"" of the movie--don't be.

If you are watching it for any other reason other than to re-inforce your religious beliefs then you would be able to understand how poor the quality of film this is. Right from the start, the poor acting, 6th-grade level script and choppy plot give you the sense you are watching a made-for-tv movie... perhaps one you would see on the hallmark channel. Was looking for something inspirational instead this movie was a just an advertisement for the Church. Two stars for the concept.","2.0 "

We both found the film engaging and thought provoking. There are no easy fixes as the main character after surviving an abusive childhood and an unimaginable tragedy comes face to face with God and explores the eternal questions. Questions include why does God allow suffering and why does God allow the people who cause suffering to get away with it? The trifold nature of God as father-son-spirit is beautifully portrayed, and the cinematography from the makers of Life of Pi is breathe taking. This is an engaging film with real characters, raw pain, and important wisdoms about loving, forgiveness, trusting God, dealing with grief, and living life fully.PS - the middle eastern actor provides hands down the best movie portrayal of Jesus ever.","5.0 "

"The Shack","God loves us through the worst tragedies","TOMMY C ELLIS","Every time a powerful, well-written story embraces spiritual themes controversy develops. The Shack is no exception. Some questioned the portrayal of God as three humans. Others found hints of New Age ideas--especially the notion that all humans will reach heaven--in the script. I would that my Christian brothers and sisters would lighten up when it comes to fictional novels/movies. THE SHACK is a beautiful presentation of a God who loves us through our worst tragedies. Further, I agree with many that the attempt to show how the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit interact was more beautiful poetry than theological precision. As such, it succeeded masterfully.Absorb the story. Feel the grace of God that permeates it. Know that God has used this tale of tragedy and hope to introduce many to himself. This type of creativity deserves to be encouraged. So, kudos to the author of the novel, and those who translated the story from page to screen!","5.0 "

"The Shack","Great Movie Even if You Are Not Religious","Alexander","To begin this review, I think it’s important to show you the viewpoint that I am coming from. I grew up with a religious background and as I grew up I gradually started believing in other religions than my own, currently I don’t have much religious belief but I don’t view other’s beliefs as wrong or unjust, just different than my own. I think it’s important that I cleared this up before starting my review, because I chose not to focus on the religious aspect of the movie as much as the emotional aspect and the story itself.To start off, this film is very intense at parts and has some pretty graphic scenes, but that’s exactly how life is. So don’t choose to not see this movie because it has abusive scenes, when it is crucial to the growth of the character and allows the story’s character to change throughout. Moving on, this film is ultimately about the process of grief and how one is able to either overcome grief or dwell and allow it to consume yourself. This is where the aspect of religion comes into the film, it is used as a way to show clearly the main character’s grief process. The main pillars of beliefs in religion, that I was taught growing up, are clearly presented throughout the film; forgiveness, judgement, faith, and acceptance. These are also all concepts, give or take the concept faith, in nearly everyone’s process of grief whether religious or not.This film handles the idea of grief in a very beautiful way by forcing the main character to come into conflict with himself and his own beliefs and judgements that he has on his own grief. The film is a journey through his grief process and his process of healing overall. As a non-religious man I found this process of healing to be very beautiful even without focusing on the religious aspects of the film. I was truly able to view it all as a story rather than, what many critics have said to be a lesson that religion and God are the only way out. I’ve read, from many sources, that this film is just a long over preachy sermon, but that’s because they only chose to pay attention to the religious aspect and chose not to separate it from their own judgements about a religious film. If you are watching an alien movie, it is typically going to be over preachy belief that aliens are real; and so it goes with films from all genres; romance will teach romance is central to life, children’s films discuss a lesson that is central to children’s understanding of the world, and so on. I just don’t think it’s a fair judgment to say it’s over preachy belief on God, when it isn’t even that preachy compared to other films in the same genre.The acting is also wonderful from the main cast. Octavia Spencer does a WONDERFUL job portraying “Papa” or God. She truly brings a warmness into the role that really allowed me to be comfortable with her character and receptive to what she was saying. The rest of the cast as well do a really fine job acting, there are some aspects that aren’t the best, but overall I didn’t have too many issues with any of the cast.Overall, I really enjoyed the film for its look at grief, an issue that most people of all backgrounds can relate to. The film was pretty fair to the book, although I read it 6 years ago so my memory on the exact details aren’t extremely clear. I found there was few things added that allowed the story to grow in a different way than the book. I would recommend this film to both religious and non-religious people alike. The concept of grief is treated so beautifully and the story of meeting God is also a very interesting concept andstory within itself.","4.0 "

But because I have studied NDE experiences for more than a decade, I decided to spend the money with the thought that perhaps there was something in this movie that I could understand from a different perspective.With that said, I was very pleased and enjoyed it so much that I watched it twice in a single day (you get more from it the second time through).As I researched the criticism I found that most of it stemmed from both religious and non religious alike but I wanted to know why (because it is an excellent movie). For christians, the drawback and main reason they disliked it was because they thought it was ""blasphemous"" in how the Trinity was presented, which created an immediate negative response from many (if not most). What was not understood was that the entire experience was an NDE as opposed to a doctrinal statement (which few seem to understand). This created chaos in the minds of those who wanted orthodox handling of the subject matter. But an NDE is an extremely difficult series of concepts to understand and is designed to work with the individual and how their mind works.For non-christians, it depicted a christian God system, as opposed to their personal belief systems which in turn created frustration for them and made the movie impossible to enjoy. For if the movie is correct, then they would be wrong, which does not sit well with most viewers.For the atheist, it created frustration and lacked credibility because it was based on a true story, which they cannot believe.Consequently it now makes sense as to why the reviews would be bad. Yet the movie is well thought out and performed very nicely.Bad things happen to good people and to the innocent which in turn causes frustration and a rejection of God. This movie addresses that issue in a simple but sufficient way.","5.0 "

"The Shack","A Motivating and Beautiful Message Regardless of Your Religious Beliefs...A Must See","moviebuff","I too will join the list of reviewers who found this story to be outstanding. I saw the movie yesterday not knowing for sure what it was about. I am a mental health therapist so I was seeing the movie more through the eyes of a therapist without, however, neglecting the importance of it as a Christian movie. The grieving process was beautifully handled and Octavia Spencer gave, in my opinion, another outstanding performance. Sam Worthington has always been a favorite (Hacksaw Ridge) and I had no idea that Tim McGraw had let of his Southern drawl for a movie career. The movie is undoubtedly sad, but nevertheless very uplifting at the same time. I have always believed in ""As one door closes another one opens"" and this movie exemplifies that beautifully. This father lost his daughter, probably the most horrific loss a parent could ever endure, and in its a place emerged a better husband and father for the remaining people in his life who still needed him. Through his loss he gained and became all around better person. Some of the surreal moments in the photography added to the gentleness of the message being conveyed throughout the moment and the logical process of turning this man's view around from hatred to love was beautifully portrayed. I honestly believe that regardless of a person's religious beliefs (or lack of them) the idea of allowing yourself the feeling of deep pain trusting that it might lead to growth is something that anybody can relate to. Yes, I now want to read the book although I am not a reader of fiction normally. I rate this movie as one of the highest ratings I have ever given. To come out of a movie not only feeling highly entertained but with some valuable messages about life makes it more than worthwhile in my book.","5.0 "

I just think the perceptions or conflicted beliefs we have about God are reflected in this movie.  Most want to believe God as perfectly loving but truthfully don't. Being in this world brings along experiences of pain and suffering and we tend to attach blame on to God or justify our reasons for being upset with Him or thinking He is unloving.  God is always with us.  Connected to us.  We are the ones denying Him.  Our fears create an unloving world.  We must learn to know love.  The way is to be at least willing to suspend past beliefs and dogmas to allow Truth in and illuminate our heart and soul.  I hope more movies like this continue to be made.","4.0 "

"The Shack","""The Shack"" is pretty good.","Kris King","""The Shack"" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: After the abduction and presumed death of Mackenzie Allen Phillips' youngest daughter, Missy, Mack receives a letter and suspects it is from God, asking him to return to The Shack where Missy may have been murdered. After contemplating it, he leaves his home to go to The Shack for the first time since Missy's abduction and an encounter that will change his life forever.The cast led by Sam Worthington (as Mack), Octavia Spencer (as Papa) & Tim McGraw (as Willie) is pretty good. The directing by Stuart Hazeldine is pretty good. The screenplay (based on the novel by William P. Young, Wayne Jacobsen & Brad Cummings, who also produced) by John Fusco, Andrew Lanham & Destin Daniel Cretton is pretty good.The music by Aaron Zigman is pretty good. The cinematography by Declan Quinn is pretty good. The film editing by William Steinkamp (who also co-produced) is pretty good. The casting by Deborah Aquila & Tricia Wood is pretty good. The production design by Joseph C. Nemec III is pretty good. The art direction by Gwendolyn Margetson is pretty good. The set decoration by Tracey Doyle, set designs by Cheryl Marion & David Hadaway, set dressings by Steven Hoffart & Todd Keller is pretty good. The costume design by Stacy Caballero & Karin Nosella is pretty good. The sound mixing by Eric Batut, Dean Giammarco & Bill Sheppard is pretty good. The special effects coordinated by Tony Lazarowich is pretty good. The visual effects coordinated by April Fortin & James Fouche and supervised by Ray McIntyre Jr. & Chris Van Dyck is pretty good.This is a solid, pretty good and entertaining movie that is well-done and solidly made.

"The Shack","Enunciate! Please!!!","Dix88","If there were a rating between three & four stars, I'd give it that. I didn't Love it but I didn't hate it.I am a Christian. I call myself a ""Jesus Freak"" to distinguish myself from a raised in the church, ""Everything in the Bible is True"" fundamentalist type Christian.One of my college degrees was in Medieval Literature, so I recognized this immediately as a Medieval Morality Play. A person meets beings from Heaven (and Hell, usually) and experiences a transformation.I don't have a problem like some of the Christians here in that the movie didn't adhere strongly to Biblical teachings (which ones? there are so many) But some of it was a little too New Age for me.I believe the Bible is a large collection of writings. Like a library. There is the Genesis: stories about creation. Every culture has these types of stories. Job was a play created to act out the anger & fear everyone feels when they think they have been abandoned by God. Kings is history, telling about real people who lived. Leviticus is a book of the ancient laws of Israel. These laws helped that nation survive. We do not have to follow those laws any more, since Jesus came to die for our sins. But I do think that in Exodus, where the 10  Commandments were given to Moses, is still relevant. What could be wrong with following those rules? Do not kill, do not envy, do not steal, etc.Psalms are beautiful poems. Song of Solomon is a strongly erotic poem, showing that God created sex to be a good experience. The words of Jesus are wonderful truths & I do believe that He died for us.So it didn't bother me to see God as Octavia Spencer, a black woman. Why not? God can take Any form He wants to take. And Jesus as a Middle Eastern guy. Well, He was. And the Holy Spirit as a woman, not a problem. I've always felt the Holy Spirit was more feminine than masculine.I loved Octavia Spencer throughout the movie & loved Avraham Aviv Alush as Jesus. He was just fun. Loving, fun, cool. I loved it when He helped Mac walk/run on the lake.Things that did bother me: the Mumbling, gruff voices of the men (not the guy playing Jesus) but all the human men had the same muttering, indistinct, gruff voices. This had to be direction. Or casting? They cast guys who can barely enunciate? Really hard to understand what Mac was saying 90% of the time. Was this supposed to convey an inability to communicate due to pain? If so, it didn't work for me.The woman playing the Holy Spirit had this sort of stoned look on her face the whole time. I am not sure what she was supposed to be conveying. Thoughtfulness? Concern? It came across as ""I know better than you"" which of course God does know more than we know but it was sort of annoying.And all the New Age ""forgive everyone"" even child murderers, was somewhat annoying.. I still have a hard time with that. I think God will judge us all. I don't believe in an eternal hell. I have had 2 NDEs and I believe we do go through a life review/judgement. And that can feel like forever in hell or purgatory for anyone who has done a lot of bad things. But I do believe that child murderers spend a LONG time in that judging place. So do mass murderers, like Hitler.You don't just whisper ""I forgive"" to a ladybug & your horrible experience flies away. And yes The Great Spirit in this movie did say you might have to forgive 1,000 times. It does take forever.I have tried to forgive my father 1,000 times. But each time I did forgive him, he beat me again or yelled at me to kill myself. So that is why I have a hard time with this ""forgive everyone"" idea.I am leaving it up to God to forgive him. When he died I felt nothing but Relief that he was out of my life. And in my NDEs, I was not told to forgive him. I was told to be brave.I get that little kids who are violently abused might become abusers. Although I did not, I chose not to have kids in order not to repeat my father's violence. And I have never been mean to kids who aren't mine.  So every abused kid does not become an abusive parent. However, I see what the story tellers were trying to say. We don't really understand each person's childhood pain & that pain can warp us.As someone who had NDEs, I know that death is not at all painful. And the after-life/Heaven is just right there, the minute your soul leaves your human body. So even murdered children go right up into Heaven.But it would still be extremely hard for me to forgive a person who killed one of my nieces or nephews. Not that this movie made it look easy. It's just that it was so intensely New Age with Papa, Jesus & Sarayu beaming benevolently on while Mac went through all his travails in the spirit world.But this is not my story, it's the story William Paul Young wrote & that this director & the actors created. So it was interesting. High quality film making. Great cinematography, the heaven scene was gorgeous, so was the garden of eden/Mac's garden. Very good acting (except the mumbling). So four stars.","4.0 "

So the movie was a new story to me since I had forgotten about what I had read in the book. Now I am not a particularly religious person, but I have questions like many do. This movie had answers for me and explained them in absolute laymen's terms where it just make's sense if you know what I mean. It is not a preachy movie whatsoever but successfully delivers answers in a way that ANYONE can come to terms with, even if you are a 98% disbeliever, but have that 2% worth of an open mind.It does pull on your heartstrings, so if you do not like to cry or tear up in front of others, watch this alone, but if you don't mind that, then its a wonderful experience to share with your family.

"The Shack","I wept like I haven't wept in many years","Meg Hauser","I am a scientist and former (militant) atheist, turned Christian in recent years. After watching this movie, I hardly even have words to describe what it did for me. I wept like I haven't wept in many years, and felt my heart opening as the story unfolded, as if it were me and not Mack who was progressing on his sacred journey. The message of The Shack rings truer to my soul than any fact in a textbook or argument posed by a skeptic. I can scarce understand how one could watch this and not be moved to tears and faith, for even the abstract prospect of a Love as profound and infinite as that of God and Jesus and the Holy Ghost is frankly overwhelming. Perhaps that is why the movie has received criticism: again, man cannot even comprehend such Love, so he mocks and shuns it. To me, this movie is simultaneously ancient and ahead of its time. It cuts to the true core of Christianity: that we are infinitely loved, that we are infinitely connected, and that God is always with us. And that forgiveness, kindness, and faith/trust/surrender are the keys to truly realizing these facts. This is what Jesus preached. Since Jesus, we have seen many centuries of Christians getting weighed down by pomp, ceremony, technicalities, dogma, doctrine, losing sight of what's really important. (God has no gender, so everyone, calm down that He is played as a woman!) And I see this as where Christianity is headed in the future: returning to its more mystical roots. I highly recommend everyone who is interested check out Friar Richard Rohr at the Center for Action and Contemplation. This man is a visionary who is bringing Christians back to the true meaning of their faith. The Shack is part of that movement, and I intend to rewatch it with regularity to remind myself of this message that is the most important of all messages. How lucky I feel to have discovered this movie, that it reawakened this deep knowing of Love in my soul.","5.0 "

It had an excellent cast with many established actors and I enjoyed the movie, though I did think it was, at times, a little predictable.  It was not preachy and the acting was well done.  What bothered me really, was what the heck was up with Sam Worthington's accent?  I mean, it seemed like he was trying to go for an American accent but his Aussie accent peeked out so much I wondered why they didn't just let him do it with the Aussie accent.  And what was up with him speaking, the entire movie, in that gruff whisper???  Is that how they think people talk in the Pacific Northwest?  (We don't, by the way). So that was distracting and irritated me because there didn't seem to be a reason for it. Maybe it was mentioned in the book that he talked that way.  I liked it, but it had some issues.  Overall I give it a 4 but compared to other Christian films it probably was more like a 5.","4.0 "
"The Shack","Great Parable","Rika","We love that movie ,just watched it last night. It's maint heme is how much God loves us and that he is good. Reading some reviews on rotten tomatoes I must some people misunderstood some aspects of the story. It never says that sin is good,but does have consequences. It does say evil is bad. It has some riddles in it I guess which some people misunderstand. It talks about forgiveness in a horrible situation,not agreeing with the evil act. Also it does not cover everything in the bible,just that the main character of God is Love,God is love. It's great how it shows Macks inner turmoil while he struggles with these issues .and in the end he becomes a peaceful person,who gets back into a relationship with a loving God.Also God is presented as female and male,sure it feels strange at first seeing him as a female,but he is both or neither. I also loved the other 2 characters Jesus,who was acted out by a Jewish  believer and the gentle Asian woman as holy spirit sarayu ,which means wind .It is more like a parable. We'll worth watching .Sam Worthington did an excellent job playing the msin character mack. He was very believable.","4.0 "
"The Shack","Strange movie; very strange","g","The saving grace for this movie was the stunning photography. The movie itself was too much, very strange and upsetting rather than uplifting. So many tragedies in the scope of a couple of hours made it almost unbelievable. The three actors who played the Trinity just didn't pull it off. Modalism at it's best. Though we watched the movie to the end, we couldn't wait until it was over. Consider renting a CS Lewis or J. R. R. Tolkien movie instead.","1.0 "

"The Shack","Therefore the whole story should be interpreted like a dream","Jack Brennan Carter, Jr., M.D.","I am a conservative Christian, so I want to speak to conservative Christians. Many who write or speak against ""The Shack"", have never seen the movie. Ipsa loquitor. The movie/book is all based on a DREAM the main character has while in a coma or similar state. Therefore the whole story should be interpreted like a dream. Alternatively the movie/book is like a parable. In the parable of Luke 16 where the rich man dies and talks to Lazarus the beggar in Heaven, and asks for cool water on his tongue and that his family be warned, do we interpret this parable to mean people  in hell can talk to people in Heaven ? Of course not. The point of parables is to understand the CENTRAL THEME but not to take each point literally. In Luke 18, the parable of the unjust judge, are we to believe God is an unjust judge? No! We're to get the central theme: persistance in prayer! To me this is the right approach to this dream (movie). What are the central points, not what are the non significant side points. My response to the very few non-orthodox lines in the book/movie would be: ""eat the fish, but spit out the bones!"" In other words, take home the ""orthodox"" central points, and throw away the things that seem non-biblical. As someone who's wife has stage 4 Cholangiocarcinoma, I find the story to be incredibly healing. I find it uniquely Trinitarian. For those fans of Brennan Manning, this movie was the movie Brennan Manning, author of ""The Ragamuffin Gospel"" would have loved! I know, Brennan was a personal friend.","5.0 "
"The Shack","Watched it 3 times! Absolutely breathtaking!","Joel Killion","After reading the book 3 times, watching the movie 2 times in the theater and then again on DVD, I've been inspired and drawn deeper into an ever-expanding, ever-growing relationship of love and affection with the Lord. Of course, as is often true, the book is better than the movie, and yet the movie perfectly represents the core message of the book, which is the relentless, transformational love of God. This is the kind of book/movie that has to be read/watched every year as a conduit of refreshment in the power of forgiveness and unconditional love. I can't recommend it enough!","5.0 "

I've patiently waited for the movie but due to my deployment schedule I wasn't able to catch it in the theatre but as soon as I saw it on the shelf a few days ago I picked up a copy and watched it with a friend last night.  I liked it so much that I ordered a copy for my 85 year-old mother who loved the book also.It was very true to the book and was very emotional for me because my wife died a few years ago from thyroid cancer at 48 and I felt the same way Mac did towards God with his loss because I was mad at God for taking my wife so soon.  It took me about a year to get through a day without reliving that pain over and over again.The special features are pretty good; nothing like a Peter Jackson/Ken Burns type documentary/special features but it was pretty good none the less.  It could've bee better had they had the entire Delilah episode about this movie instead of a few snips of interviews.","5.0 "
"The Shack","I cannot believe this love that God lavishes upon us!  It's UNCONDITIONAL, fierce, and unchanging!","Jesusgirl77","The Shack is absolutely beautiful! A must see for everyone!  Having been abandoned by a biological father and then later a step father, not to mention many other bad things in my life,  to say that I had a VERY messed up view of who God is and what His character is like is an understatement.  Some years ago I crashed into God.  My life was a wreck, nothing and no one could fix it but like they say,""There's a hole in everyone's heart that only God can fill.""  I asked Jesus to be my Lord and my life completely changed! For the best! I must say It was hard at first because every time I would mess up or sin I was afraid that God would abandon me just like my earthly fathers had. I thought I needed to act perfectly or God would be angry and leave.  You know what? I was wrong. He never has!  All my failures and shortcomings, He never changes and neither does His love.  And that is why I love Him sooooo much because He first loved us.So If you are hurting and broken, lost someone precious, been abandoned or had a terrible tragedy in your life like me, Jesus is the answer.Another great movie is "" Ragamuffin"" The life of Rich Mullins.","5.0 "

"The Shack","Good for adults who want something very deep, but don't watch it with your kids","Morgan","This movie is PG-13 for a reason. I would definitely NOT recommend it as one that the entire family should watch together. My main reasoning (spoilers ahead) is that I was not expecting Mack's ""personal tragedy"" to be the abduction and murder of his young daughter. This part of the movie was tastefully done, but if I'd been watching this with a young child, I don't think we would have finished. If I'd watched it as a young girl, I know I would have been terrified, and the message about God's love despite the evil in the world would have gone completely over my head. Even as the mother of young children this was almost more than I could handle. This is not a movie kids should watch.Overall, it just was not as uplifting as I hoped. There was so much that was depressing in so short a time that I finished it feeling completely drained. There were good messages to ponder back on, but I think I would have liked the book better. This was just too much at once to actually enjoy the movie-watching experience.","3.0 "

"The Shack","Beautifully acted","cinlmonthornton","This movie follows the book very closely.  I read the book years ago, and I remembered the feeling I had at reading the book.  I cried in a crowded theater during this movie, and I noticed others literally crying aloud, they were so moved..  And when we got up at the end of the movie, people moved toward one another and hugged strangers.  It was like being at church.  This is a powerful message, and yes, it's Wm Paul Young's imagination.  Not one of us who has not been to heaven can know for sure what it's like.  Nor can we know what God sees when he looks at our imperfect lives, but we know he loves us.  The Bible is a love letter.  Read it.  I also recommend reading The Case for Christ by Lee Strobel.  I just finished it and found all of the evidence of Christ very compelling, but I am a believer, not a doubter.  I was born again at the age of 12.","5.0 "
"The Shack","Encountering God","Nikki","This is a Christian movie. You will love it or dislike it. It is a movie about trust, forgiveness and moving on after tragedy strikes your family. It's a film that allows us to see God through our own eyes and makes it okay to develop our own unique relationship and experiences with Jesus Christ and how we relate to the Trinity. It doesn't answer all the questions that many have as to why does God allow some families to go through tragedy? Yet, it should not, for we are not God and only God can answer many of our pertinent questions. This is a film that I would highly recommend, not for a person to find peace after a tragedy, but to discover Jesus in your own unique way.","5.0 "

Some things in the movie spoke to me. Where do you stop condemning people that hurt you? Do you stop at the person who hurt you, or the person that hurt them, or the next person? The legacy of brokenness goes all the way back to Adam and Eve. If you're having difficulty forgiving someone who did something, I suggest watching it. It may not help you let it go and fully forgive them, but it will crack the wall you put around it so you can begin to work on finally forgiving them.","5.0 "

When you watch a movie in slices then terminally chop it 3/4 way through in favor of mentally chastising yourself for the nine bucks you blew for it, that's bad. Cheeky and flat. No wait, flat and cheeky. I grew up during Neil Young's time, very much enjoy his music to this day, but when ""God"" puts in an off-the-wall plug for him out of the blue - oh please. And what about folks who don't even know Neil Young? Oh double-please. (Did Neil Young co-sponsor the film? If not, why the plug? If so, why the plug? And why a plug from God, of all entities (who treats his children equal?) but is just wild about Neil Young? oh please. Generally, the only folks that even know Neil Young are baby-boomer range. (Is this movie secretly intended to proselytize baby-boomers?) Please, the script was 5th grade level, if that. And drilling down to the ""theological"" core, here we find a hip niche hybrid that all original translations of ""Christianity"" entirely disavow -  a laid-back nonjudgmental God full of frayed one-liners.

"The Shack","What a surprise!","Im4Givinn","Though I liked parts of the book very much, there were other parts I found presumptuous and misleading, especially when the author put words into God's mouth. I was never able to read the book as simple fiction, because so much of it presents as an allegory with some important real-life lessons to teach. I found many of those to be out-of-synch with the Bible's teachings. But the movie does an amazing job of leaving most of those out and being downright profound. I doubt that the real God would be as hesitant to own being ""wrathful"" as Papa was in the movie; some evil in the world cannot be redeemed and so will be consumed by the fire that God is. But everything else in the movie ranged from being good to downright wonderful. Amazing. I loved it.","5.0 "

I have seen a lot in life and his daughters remind me of my two daughters and I just couldn't imagine.  Beyond that, this movie to me brings forth the idea of what I believe and brings forth light and a new concept on how to better understand something that is much bigger than us.

It's one of those movies that you need to watch at least a few times more, because every time you see it you pick up on something you missed the first time. What an outstanding movie this is. Someone told me the reason that God was shown as a woman was because Max had such an abusive father that he (Max) wouldn't have been receptive otherwise. It makes a good point, not sure if it's a point the writer's were trying to make or not, but gives you something to think about. I especially loved the scene with Max and Wisdom.

But I love Sam Worthington and Octavia Butler so it was worth renting it via Redbox. It's a good family movie if you want to help explain good and evil to young adults, but it's too elementary to help adults through painful times.

"The Shack","Sappy melodrama about surviving a tragic loss","The Movie Man","“The Shack,"" based on the bestseller by William Paul Young, stars Sam Worthington (“Avatar”) as Mack, a lapsed churchgoer, devoted husband, and father of three kids. During a camping trip with his children, Mack’s youngest is abducted and murdered. Afterwards, he’s completely devastated — a mere shell of his former self. While his wife (Radha Mitchell) and best friend Willie (Tim McGraw) find solace and spiritual healing in God, Mack moves forward lacking spiritual guidance.Consumed by survivor’s guilt and grief, Mack receives a mysterious note in his mailbox from “Papa,” the name his wife gives to God. Papa is inviting him to a shack in the woods where his daughter was killed. He doesn’t know if this is a bad joke, but emotionally desperate, he heads into the snowy wilderness to find out.The premise of “The Shack” is terribly dark, but ultimately, the movie aspires to an uplifting message. Once Mack gets to the shack, he is given a basic tutorial by three individuals in how to find comfort in Christianity. More suitable for a Lifetime broadcast, the film delves headfirst into a sales pitch for religion as the cure-all when tragedy strikes. Using the death of a child is loading the deck. Either you will buy into the melodrama and tear up or totally reject its blatant manipulation.Ms. Mitchell, Mr. McGraw, and Octavia Spencer, who plays a motherly stranger filled with lessons in faith, survival, and acceptance, are all excellent. Worthington, however, looks dazed throughout. This may because his Mack is so distraught that he’s going through life zombie-like, but seeing one expression for the entire movie gets tedious.Special features on the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include five behind-the-scenes featurettes, footage of the movie’s premiere, deleted scene, and audio commentary with director Stuart Hazeldine.

"The Shack","Depressing and unsatisfying","Stonewall63","I watched this on a plane trip home. My first thought was that I was happy that I didn't actually buy it. My second feeling was that I was totally depressed about its contents. Forgiveness is one thing, but the way the portrayed deity seems to handle Mack's overwhelming grief seemed trite and superficial. I thought the interaction of ""wisdom"" with Mack bordered on the cruel. I was left with the sense that Mack was being told to either suck it up and forgive the monster that destroyed his daughter, or choose to wallow in his grief and be a lesser human. I just didn't think the interaction between the deity and Mack was especially healing. I would also note that I thought the book was better, with the interplay between Mack and the deity more intense and understanding. I guess the bottom line is that when the time comes, heaven looks pretty good and we will answer for our actions. In the meantime, though, don't assume that the deity is going to step in and prevent a tragedy. That job is ours alone. From a production standpoint, the acting was reasonable though predictable, the characters stereotypic, the story line manipulative, and the ending unsatisfying.","2.0 "
"The Shack","Mind Boggling!","Peggy S. Buckingham","Mind boggling!  Although the characters were hard to get used to, the overall message made this movie well worth watching.  It's every parents nightmare.  I DID find this one interesting.  Overall this was right on as far as how a person might feel about life events. Plus it makes us wonder if God really could see us this way. It kinda made sense!","5.0 "

"The Shack","Surprisingly touching and spiritually uplifting!","Olga Teisseyre","I watched this movie at the cinema today (in USA) and I was surprised by the spiritual context for understanding grief and healing. It was a touching movie and had me in tears many times.I feel like it's an important story to tell - a man's journey of healing and coming to terms with the loss of his daughter. I.e. what happens AFTER a tragic event.It was visually appealing - the landscape and also the ease of interacting with a topic that could have been portrayed with much more heaviness. Though some of the film seemed a little oversimplified that didn't detract from its symbolism and beauty.Though I enjoyed this film at the cinema, I'm sure it would be great as a DVD of watched online.","5.0 "

"The Shack","Twisted through literary license","Krae","If you watch this movie (or read the book) and remember it is fiction, then the story is just ok.  The problem is the inference that this fiction is a reflection of Biblical truth, which it is not.  I think everyone can relate to depression in one form or another and so this story touches us because we've either experienced deep depression or know someone who has, even if not due to the murder of a child. Without spoiling anything for those who have not seen the movie or read the book, or for those who have not read The Book (Holy Bible), the author takes literary license with Biblical truth - God (the Father), Christ (the Son) and the Holy Spirit.  But don't take my word for it.  Check out the Word itself - read the Bible.","2.0 "

"The Shack","Meh.","Cheryl L. Lester","If you're a Christian you'll probably appreciate this film. It was occasionally heartwarming, however it was missing so many important elements and philosophies. I'm a spiritual person but affiliate with no religion, so it missed the mark for me personally. (Spoiler Alert). Also the idea that they recover the girl's body but bury it as opposed to calling police - was just so strange to me, even if that was apparently a dream. What about the Mother and her right to bury her daughter? Overall I found most of this movie ridiculous on quite a few levels.  Was very disappointed I'd spent the money to rent it on PPV.  Giving it 2 stars because the acting was good and I like the actors, otherwise a flop.","2.0 "

"The Shack","God is a short woman who bakes cookies","captainbars","Just finished watching it.  It was disapointing and disturbing that God had a sex change, because he said Mac couldn't handle being with a man, or father figure at the moment.  Baloney.  Then, a young Asian woman protrayed the Holy Spirit.  Later, Jesus said she was His spirit.  Jesus has the spirit of a woman?  They never call Him by the name of Jesus, just mention once or twice that He's the Son, but there's no doubt who He is, especially when you see the nail scars on His wrists.  In another scene, Papa (God) and Mac are talking on the porch, and Papa, disagreeing with Mac, gets up and remarks that men are such idiots.  Hello.  God made man in His own image.  It sounded like female talk.  God is our heavenly Father, a male.  His Spirit, the Holy Spirit, is male.  Why are so many people, anti-male?  Why didn't the author protray Papa as a man?  He's a short woman, who was called Papa--what an incongruity.  To help us accept Mac being surrounded by females, the movie keeps our attention on a tear-jerker of a story that deals with the death of a child, and the ensuing anger, bitterness, grief, unforgiveness  that follows.  Mac is taken step by step through thoughtful, well writen scenes dealing with his shattered heart.  He forgives, and begins to heal.  The editing was also well done, as we see Mac's dad was also abused.  The bible says Wisdom is female, but in keeping with the formula, I guess she should've been male.  I was certain the author would be female, but saw a man wrote it.  I didn't read the book, since I didn't hear about it till I was looking for Christian movies.  And I won't be reading it.  I don't like it that God's image was changed.  As the credits came up, a beautiful song played, and I thought, so this is what passes as a Christian movie now?  In one of the end scenes, Mac is in church and he looks up at the stained glass windows showing God with a long flowing beard.  I almost laughed as I imagined he was thinking about ""Papa;"" a short woman, who wore dresses and slacks, and gave him baking pointers.  I see a lot of people liked the movie, and the book.  Okay.  I just never believed in Gaia or mother earth.  I believe in the Word of God.","2.0 "

The book breaks it down in more depth, but I love how the movie brings things to life visually, and especially the anger that was expressed through Mackenzie towards God. In God's eyes, that's how many of us act when we're bitter towards him. Excellent capture of emotions that display the sin nature in humanity.","5.0 "

Carpenter","In a world where the utterly banal ""Gangham Style"" can wrack up nearly 2,936,089,490 views, it should not be surprising that ""The Shack"" has beenrated 4 1/2 stars, as highly as ""The Godfather"", and given five stars by almost as many viewers (in terms of percent) as ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""Ben Hur"".  There would be no point and it would be a futile effort to point out the many, glaring cringeworthy moments in a film ostensibly made to give a buzz to evangelicals and other assorted fundamentalists. The irony of ""The Shack"" is that had it merely been a tale of a family of faith torn apart by tragedy, and the struggles of each to reconcile the brutal murder or a little girl with a previously blind faith in an all-merciful God, the God of the 91st Psalm (""He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty...surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.), this film might have not only been thought provoking to those who don't buy into Christianity's fickle diety, byt perhaps even transformative.A pity.Instead we are bludgeoned with trite explanations of profound Christian mysteries such as the dizzying concept of the Trinity. (If, according to this film, God was present at Calvary, and Saroya (the Holy Spirit is not an aspect of God but God also, why didn't she have scars on her wrist?).Then too, there is the apparent and shameless palming of new-age concepts such as Mackenzie being given the choice (apparently he IS having a near-death experience) of remaining alive and returning to his family or going into the light and being with his deceased daughter. One cringeworthy moment had a female character called ""Wisdom"" telling Mack he judged people by their skin color, physical appearance, and BODY LANGUAGE. This woman is the incarnation of wisdom and this is her profound insight?One of my favorite moments was when ""Papa"" called Mack an idiot and muttered under her breath a feminist's exasperated ""Men!"" I suppose the all-knowing Jehovah forgot that her kid reputedly cautioned his followers that one was in danger of hell-fire even if they called their brother ""raca""--a fool.One could go on with the banalities of ""The Shack"" but it will do little in the way of changing the opinions of those who found it profoundly illuminating, and emotionally gratifying.I only wish Amazon gave reviewers the option of no stars.","1.0 "

"The Shack","As a conservative Christian I found the movie pretty bad. The acting was nominal and the storyline ...","T. M. Jones","As a conservative Christian I found the movie pretty bad.  The acting was nominal and the storyline heretical.  While there are a couple of good points (It raises the problem of evil and offers God’s love and hope to those who’ve been overwhelmed by tragedies they can’t reconcile with God’s sovereignty and goodness.  From several testimonies it has also helped many people see the warmth within the triune God, and God’s warmth toward them as well.  It attempts to deal with the pain of loss and where God is in that process.  It does portray God as loving (but then distorts that love into Universalism or Universal Reconciliation).If one reads Young's ""Lies We Believe About God"" you get a far better and clearer picture of how and why he portrays the Trinity and the Bible the way he does in this book/film.  Based on what he writes Young is no where near being a Christian as defined by the Bible (again, this is based only on what he has written - I do not presume to know his heart).  He has, instead, created a god in his own image and to his own liking based on his own desires (something man has done for millennia).  While the storyline is extremely emotive and carries the viewer along it is, in the end, a story based on faulty ""Hallmark"" theology that ends up being feel good but offers nothing of substance.  While it is a novel and therefore not a work of proper theology, it is a novel based on his theology and therefore opens itself up to criticism of that theology.  I realize that most will disagree with this review since the bulk of our Christian community today base their theology on how they feel as opposed to what the Bible says, playing to their emotions as opposed to God's objective word.  The fact that many Christians like this book/film reveals a disastrous failure of evangelical discernment and Biblical understanding.  As Christian we simply cannot live our lives by feeling or emotion (that will and has always ended in disaster).  if I could give this movie zero stars I would.","1.0 "

"The Shack","I was pleasantly surprised at how well-written it is and the theological substance of it; God's grace is explained well","Christopher Schwinger","I've known about the book The Shack since it came out 10 years ago, but I never took the time to learn much about it.  I had heard it has a black woman representing God, which some Christians were okay with and others weren't.  I was pleasantly surprised by what I found when seeing the movie.  The trailer doesn't do a very good job explaining what I was supposed to expect in the movie, because it doesn't provide a background to why he shows up at the shack and meets these personifications of God.  This main character named Mack is trying to be a good dad, but his father was abusive to him and he's hidden that from his wife and kids.  He and his wife and kids go on a camping trip at a lake somewhere near Multnomah Falls (which is in Oregon), but the canoe which his older daughter and son are in tips over.  He dives into the water to rescue 'em, but during those few minutes, his younger daughter is abducted.  The police discover a shack in the mountains where she was murdered but don't find her body.  In his resulting depression, Mack receives a note in the mail, with no shoeprints in the snow surrounding the mailbox, requesting he come to the shack, signed ""Papa"", which is what his wife calls God.  He goes alone up there and meets 5 characters who embody different characteristics of God, 3 of which depict the Trinity.  Octavia Spencer, the black woman playing the Father, explains that Mack isn't ready emotionally for a father figure yet.  They interact with him and take him into a luscious garden and teach him about the meaning of faith, in a series of interesting conversations with well-written dialogue.  It's like the Christian version of Yoda's training of Luke Skywalker.  I suppose some of the well-written dialogue about the meaning of suffering and whether God is trustworthy comes straight out of the book.The basic ideas are twofold:  1) Just because God doesn't stop suffering doesn't mean He approves of it, and 2) If God intervened more often to punish wrongdoers or prevent 'em from doing wrong, then where would the chain end, since most people choose to do wrong because of bad influences which came before them?  And since everyone has done some evil things, how do you judge which evil is more worthy of punishment?  A pain-free life doesn't exist, but pain doesn't mean God doesn't exist either.  In a way resembling C. S. Lewis's subtlety, the movie several times implies but doesn't directly state ""This is like Jesus dying on the cross.""  It also emphasizes that sin is its own punishment; God doesn't have to punish wrongdoers just because they failed to live up to His expectations.  They reap the bad consequences when they do wrong, which are the punishment God has put into nature.  It's because they broke the rules.  It's nothing personal; it's not like God is personally angry and chooses a specific punishment to mete out.  The movie also clarifies that forgiveness is not the excusal of wrongdoing, but giving up our right to punish the other person, because it is God who is the ultimate judge.The film is actually remarkably engaging, given that it is so philosophical.  I didn't ever feel like it was rambling from conversation to conversation, from task to task he's assigned.  Unexpectedly, I felt a little let down by the ending, just because the pace felt like it slowed down more in the last 20 minutes or so.  I wanted some emotional climax rather than just a prolonged catharsis (emotional release) when he finally gets done with his experience at the shack.  The movie Bridge of Spies ends with a rather low-key return by Tom Hanks's character from East Berlin after his mission is complete, but I found that supremely moving.  The ending of The Shack didn't move me to nearly the same degree, and I think the reason is because the movie is already so philosophical and brooding that it'd be nice to have a contrast of more vivacity and joy of living at the end, not just emotional healing.  The whole movie is introspective, and it'd have been nice to have some extroversion at the end.I think there's a lot of substance in the middle section with the  conversations he has with different personifications of God, and I'm not theologically bothered by it because I understand why it was written this way.  The movie explains that it's because he's not emotionally able to handle a father figure yet.  The Holy Spirit is depicted as an Asian woman because God is not a single race or gender, but created man and woman and every race that came out of them.  Just because Jesus was a man doesn't mean God doesn't dwell in women.At the start of the end credits, Wayne Jacobsen is thanked, whose book He Loves Me! helped me a lot in 2005-2006 when I was struggling with understanding what God's grace means.  God isn't just out to punish wrongdoers and reward good people, but rather to have a relationship with everyone who is willing.  It's not about merit, but about relationship.  I hope this movie is a blessing to many.","4.0 "

"The Shack","FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH!","(Chantal) Lisette Collins","I'd really like to say, that I don't hate the writer or any of it's readers. I don't hate the people who are in this movie or the people who wrote/produced it or the ones that saw or rented it. What I hate is the fact that it could not be farther than the TRUTH. Just when the world needs a revival, a real ""coming to Jesus"" moment, this movie diverts their attention. The devil who is the father of all LIES, would love for people who don't really know Jesus to fall for this. I really pray that they take this movie and go line by line and see if it matches up with the Holy Scriptures. It doesn't! I pray that the Holy Spirit will guide them to see the truth of who our Father truly is, what His son Jesus did for us to be with Him for all eternity.

"The Shack","The love and forgiveness of God is a great thing to ...","bobby","The love and forgiveness of God is a great thing to emphasis, and it can never be overstated.  That being said.... (deep breathe), this is an unbiblical picture of who God is in so many other ways; very dangerous in my opinion.  I know that most probably disagree.  It really misrepresents the Trinity, and as the Trinity is hard enough to comprehend, there is no need to make it harder.  So while CS Lewis was able to remain true to the God of Scripture in his picture of the Gospel in Narnia, this falls way short and beyond that, it perverts truth in many ways  (not all ways). I am not one to pick theological battles over little things, but there are some big problems here.  we do need to be discerning.","1.0 "

"The Shack","Morally Reprehensible","fruitloop","I wanted to like this film. I really did. Unfortunately this movie masquerades as a beautiful story of faith and the healing of grief. It fails in the opening minutes, with the main character committing an appalling crime - which, by the way, is never addressed. Fast forward to present time, when his family suffers horrific loss.Then he goes through the usual meeting with God, Jesus, hope, faith, ad nauseum - and is told he won't heal until and unless he forgives the perpetrator who caused his family's suffering. Ah, forgiveness.....the magic cure-all peddled by people who cause pain by forcing their victims to grant them redemption and preventing them from having to pay the price for their crimes. (Spare me your comments about ""but forgiveness doesn't mean the offender gets a pass....you can re-define the word to suit yourself,"" comments. Sell it to the gullible. I'm not one of them).This movie makes oodles of profit and wins lots of approval from religious people from its morally-reprehensible sham of a ""message."" I can only hope that eventually its fans look back on it later with fresh eyes and realize what trash it truly is, along with the supposed ""love story"" flick ""50 Shades of Gray.""

Any scripture minded person or even a Christian would know that this film is based off a heresy fest. That doesn't mean those who support this film aren't saved, I dunno if you all are or not. In my 2 years of being a Christian, I've come to distinguish heresy from the Word of God. 2 Timothy 4:3 states, "" For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear"".

"The Shack","Best movie for Persuading People to the new Christianity","Jake","If you like heresy, and want JW/Mormon teachings to influence your mind, your heart and soul, this is the movie for you. This a great rendition of 1st century heresy called modalism, combined with some universalism, and marcionism for extra flavor, all produced and made for the current generation of professing Christians. Whoever said heresy is so bad and wrong, if it's actually what makes me feel good? With all the non-trinitarian teaching today, and making Christianity all about happiness, and feeling good, accepting yourself for who you are, not that Bible stuff and Apostle  teaching about forgiveness of sins, our own depravity and wickedness before God, or holiness and justification. No, this movie will leave you getting all the things you want to hear and nothing else. I gave it four stars, since it could have been better if it flat out said they hate the God of the Bible, or hate Holiness, or said no one is a sinner, etc. It implied it, but it could have been more forward about it, but as it is, it's a near perfection for everyone wanting God to resemble man as much as possible. You won't find another movie which has this much persuasiveness and heresy, than if you went to a TJ Jake's, Joel Osteen, Joyce Meyer or Steven Furtick speech, and that's incredible. I even made sure this movie didn't make people repent and realize their sins, need a savior or anything, or worse, start reading their Bibles more. So I started asking everyone I knew that saw it, and sure enough, not only did none of them react or consider those things, whew, but even one of them started cussing and getting terribly angry, and verbally abusive to his girlfriend, the more I asked if it was biblical. Perfect!Plus, here on Amazon, which goes perfect with this movie, is 50 shades of grey sequel, as the number one recommended title for those who also bought this movie. Couldn't ask for another movie that matches this movie more perfectly. Keep up the great work","4.0 "

"The Shack","A Place to Rest Before Descending Back Into the CGI Maelstrom","Carl Schultz","An interesting rhetorical question posed from time to time during these days of movie sequels, film series, and motion pictures based upon comic books is whether one single movie in a series—say, the third chapter in the “Star Wars” saga, or the fifth picture in the “X-Men” series—can be enjoyed by a filmgoer who’s not familiar with the previous installments.The best answer to this question is that a viewer of a single chapter of a motion picture series probably has a grasp of the material similar to a person who turns on a television, tunes into a movie or program in the middle of the broadcast, and becomes interested.A number of audience members—particularly non-Christian viewers or those without religious backgrounds at all—must experience that sensation while attending a screening of “The Shack.”  Produced by Windblown Media and released by Summit Entertainment, “The Shack” is the latest picture in a growing trend in motion pictures marketing films toward a specifically Christian audience, sometimes even targeting individual denominations.Many motion picture experts claim that the film industry is now experiencing a renaissance of Christian films.  There’s always been a market for religious pictures:  Well into the 1980s it was said that a day didn’t pass without Cecil B. DeMille’s reverent 1927 silent version of “The King of Kings” being exhibited somewhere, whether in a movie theater, a civic auditorium, a school gymnasium, a church activity hall, or a public library.The current trend in Christian entertainment is usually traced back to 2004 with the enormous success of Mel Gibson’s “The Passion of the Christ,” a film depicting with brutal detail and graphic violence the final days in the life of Jesus Christ, and his crucifixion.The Gibson picture, however, despite the director’s own devout Christian beliefs could also be said to have been secular or even agnostic in nature:  The life and crucifixion of Christ, in addition to being a Biblical event, is also acknowledged as a historical fact.  The only specific detail in Gibson’s film based upon faith alone was the final shot of the picture, briefly suggesting the resurrection of Jesus following his crucifixion and corporal death.Also mentioned as a genesis of the current trend in Christian motion picture entertainment is “Fireproof,” a film released in 2008 by Sherwood Pictures which eventually became the highest-grossing independent film of that year.  Starring popular television actor Kirk Cameron, “Fireproof” was also the most successful film to date by the Kendrick brothers, Alex and Stephen, then leaders of outreach at the Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia.That church had previously provided production funds and resources for the low-budget films “Flywheel” in 2003 and “Facing the Giants” in 2006, also produced by the Kendricks.  These original efforts, with casts mostly comprised of church congregation members, became notable local regional successes in Georgia, and were eventually co-opted by Christian churches all across the country.Those pictures remain popular DVD releases.  So many DVD copies of the football-themed “Facing the Giants” were manufactured that the picture remains to this day a staple of the discount bins at Walmart stores.The Kendricks were also responsible for “The War Room” in 2015.  Produced by Affirm Films and distributed by Hollywood’s mainstream TriStar Pictures, “The War Room,” became something of a phenomenon, giving the Kendrick brothers their largest production budget to date—$3 million, pocket change by conventional Hollywood standards—and returning gross revenues exceeding $73 million, a solid motion picture hit by any standards.“The Shack” might be the most ambitious gamble to date in terms of Christian entertainment.  The film relies of a core understanding of Christian beliefs, which might be confusing to more secular or non-religious audiences.  The picture depicts the Christian Holy Trinity, the concept of God in three individual manifestations—God the Father, Jesus or God the Son, and God in the form of the Holy Spirit—a notion sometimes difficult for even Christians to grasp.  Further complicating the concept is the casting of no less than five individual actors in the three distinct personalities.In “The Shack,” Mack Phillips, a man who has survived a turbulent childhood at the hands of an alcoholic father matures into a model husband and parent.  Since his father was a devout Christian and despite the guidance of his devoutly Christian wife, Mack is mostly indifferent to faith:  He is shown attending services with his wife and three children, but not participating in the rites.But the Phillips family is dealt an unspeakable tragedy:  During a camping trip, the Phillips’ kindergarten-aged daughter is kidnapped, presumably by a sexual predator.  And as a result of a massive search by authorities and local citizens, evidence is eventually found in an isolated mountain shack strongly suggesting the child’s molestation and death.The Phillips family descends into what is referred to as The Great Sadness.  Months later, while Mack’s wife and two remaining children are visiting relatives out of town and stranded there by a snowstorm, the solitary and still-grieving Mack finds a typewritten note in his mailbox inviting him to return to the isolated shack where his daughter was murdered.  The note is signed “Papa,” his devout wife’s name for God.Believing the note to have been written by his daughter’s murderer, Mack travels to the snowbound forest location with the intention of vengeance.  Instead he discovers near the location of the shack an oasis of verdant springtime beauty…and a family of three, who introduce themselves as the Holy Trinity.  And during their time together, the three gently and lovingly guide Mack through the process of grieving and forgiveness, and reconciliation with his own religious origins.“The Shack” is based upon the novel by Canadian author William Paul Young, which became something of a literary phenomenon:  Originally self-published by the author as an explanation of faith to his children, the novel “The Shack” was discovered by Windblown Media and FaithWords Publishing, which acquired publication rights to the manuscript and distributed it widely.  “The Shack” in its book form became a bestseller, with sales of well over 10 million copies to date.The motion picture adaptation is fairly accurate to the book, with a few substantial differences.  In the movie, the child’s murderer is forgiven by Mack but never apprehended, while in the book the killer is eventually caught when as a result of Mack’s interactions with God he is able to lead authorities to his child’s remains.The film, however, has been received with almost exclusively negative if not excoriating reviews, with a 21% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a Metacritic score of 32%.  Despite the critical drubbing, however, the movie is markedly popular, earning to date over $50 million in box office revenues, a success notable enough to have kept it in mainstream motion picture venues for over a month.Despite the seamy and tragic nature of the main character’s backstory—in addition to his daughter’s death, Mack is also revealed to have at age 13 murdered his abusive alcoholic father by tainting his liquor with strychnine—“The Shack” actually turns out to be a comfortable movie, if not a traditional “comfort movie,” or even a particularly comforting one.The performances of Australian actors Sam Worthington as Mack and Radha Mitchell as his wife, with American accents, are solid and heartfelt throughout, as is the amiable appearance of country music superstar Tim McGraw as Mack’s neighbor and best friend Willie.  Jesus, played by Israeli actor Avraham Aviv Alush, is charismatic and magnetic, a Jesus with a sense of both warmth and humor.  He’s the kind of God you might like to have a beer with after work.  At one point, Jesus confides to Mack, “I’d rather have friends than slaves.”The Holy Spirit, played by Japanese actress Sumire Matsubara, is more delicate and ethereal than the other Godly manifestations, usually tending the Eden-like garden outside the shack.  A separate character representing God’s Wisdom is embodied by a firm performance by the Brazilian actress Alice Braga, identifying herself as non-judgmental but being mostly judgmental all the same.God the Father is embodied late in the film as a fountain of strength and wisdom by the reliable Native American actor Graham Greene, best known for his Academy Award-nominated performance as Kicking Bird in Kevin Costner’s megahit “Dances with Wolves” in 1990.  Greene guides Mack through the most difficult part of his journey through grief, and he’s a solid, dependable, and reassuring countenance during that difficult episode.But registering the best impact is the performance of the wonderful Octavia Spencer as Papa, the primary embodiment of God.  Spencer’s God is wise and loving, down-to-earth and plain-spoken, always ready as needed with a hug or a wisecrack or a slice of warm apple pie just out of the oven.  It’s Spencer’s God who primarily guides Mack through his sadness and toward forgiveness and reconciliation.  Also revealed during the film’s prologue as a caring neighbor during Mack’s abusive childhood, Spencer’s performance is customarily good enough it difficult to imagine any other performer in the role.Most of the filmmakers are fairly new to the production of a major motion picture, from director Stuart Hazeldine to screenwriters John Fusco, Andrew Lanham, and Destin Cretton.  The picture itself is workmanlike if uninspired, far from innovative, and actually sometimes resembling a church Easter pageant rather than a major Hollywood release.Near the end of the picture, one of the Trinity tells Mack, “Every time an act of kindness is performed, the universe changes…for the better.”It’s a sweet notion, and sensible enough.  Considering the plain fact that a new horror picture is released almost week in incremental levels of lurid depictions of death and dismemberment, hauntings and demonic possessions, “The Shack” at the very least provides a brief respite, a place of comfort among the uncertainties of life and faith.At 132 minutes, “The Shack” is sort of the opposite of a horror movie, and is at least as viable as a film in that genre and actually much, much better than most.  In the end, the PG-13 rated “The Shack” resembles nothing so much as a modern update of “It’s a Wonderful Life” for the computer age, or a Gen X version of “A Christmas Carol.”Despite its lack of originality, its sometimes amateurish staging, its simplistic depictions of religion and faith as mysteries and puzzles solved by more complex mysteries and puzzles, “The Shack” is not a bad place to visit for a while.  It’s a reassuring picture, if not a particularly unique one.  Possibly ""The Shack"" is even a place you’ll want to stop to rest before the next CGI-enhanced descent into the R-rated maelstrom.","3.0 "

"The Shack","A Christian perspective","R. Donahue","the Author says the story presented in the book is a work of allegorical fiction. That is very clear to any discerning literate person who diligently reads and studies the Bible. “The Shack” does not honestly present the God of the Bible, nor will a person find Him in “The Shack,” or gain a whole new perspective of God. “The Shack,” says that God is whatever you need Him to be. The Bible says God can only be known through Jesus Christ because He is the Creator God of all things and Lord of the Cosmos.An allegory is a story, poem, or picture that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning, typically a moral or political one. There are indeed hidden meanings in “The Shack” which are, in fact, considered heresy by traditional historical orthodox biblical Christianity. The author intentionally chose to present ‘god’ in a way that is totally contradictory to the Scriptures and more akin to a god that human beings created rather than the God who created us in His own image and likeness.The biblical description of the Triune God is diametrically opposed to the hermaphroditic goddess that the author conjured up which borders on blasphemy. There is even a fourth person added named Sophia, the Greek goddess of Wisdom. There are also a number of theological issues historically considered heresy within ""The Shack"" such as Modalism, Panentheism, Universalism, Gnosticism, Patripassianism, Necromancy, Catabolism, Anthropomorphism, Cabbalism, and Subordinationism.The author clearly infers that the Bible is not true because he reduces God's voice in the book to just paper. “The Shack” also presents the belief system of New Age universal spiritualism, which says that everyone will make it to Heaven because there is no need to acknowledge personal sin and God’s mandatory requirement for repentance and acceptance of Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior.Jesus said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no one will come to the Father but by me” (John 14:6). It does matter which way a person gets to Him. Jesus said, “Only those who believe in me will have eternal life” (John 3:15, 3:36, 5:24, 6:40).The Shack repeatedly conflicts with the Bible which says that because God is both love and just, His loving justice must prevail. As a result, He will judge people because of their sinfulness and rejection of His offer of salvation through Jesus Christ alone (Matt 12:20; Rom 3:25-26). Jesus said, “Narrow is the way that leads to eternal life.” “The Shack,” says there is no eternal judgment and torment in a place called Hell, yet Jesus Himself spoke of it (Luke 12:5, 16:23).“The Shack” infers that God will submit to human wishes and choices. However, the Bible declares that God is absolutely holy and cannot look upon sin. “The Shack” also says that God the Father was crucified with Jesus yet the Bible says that it was Jesus alone who willingly chose to become human and took upon Himself the sins of all human beings when He hung on the Cross to be the final sacrifice for sin (Hab 1:13; Matt 7:13-15, 27:45).""The Shack"" says that God is constantly changing and being transformed along with the Christian, yet, the Bible says, “In Him there is no change,” for He is the same yesterday, today, and forever” (Heb 11:12, 13:8; also James 1:17).In spite of the book begin contrary to the written Word of God, I am sure that in the emergent, spiritualist / New Age and the seeker-sensitive / post-modern churches of today, there will no doubt be “The Shack” Sermon Series and Small Group Study Guides coming out soon.“The Shack” is simply not a new allegory of Scripture such as Paul Bunyan in the book “Pilgrim’s Progress” or the writings of C.S. Lewis, who took the theological teachings of Scripture and allegorized them. “The Shack” is a fable that has taken heretical teaching and rejected the teaching of the Bible.To teach doctrine is the purpose of writing theological fiction. However “The Shack” creates doctrinal confusion about the Trinity, the character and nature of God, the absolute balance of His love and holiness with His justice and the reason for the atonement. Christians don't need a book of allegorical fiction to help them understand the character and nature of Almighty God - Jesus Christ. They just need to read and study His written Word, the Bible, because it is the only reliable source to know Him personally and hear His voice!","1.0 "

"Darkest Hour","Superb performance by Oldman!","Kate W","I literally just read a 1 star review of this movie because the person was offended by Churchill (Oldman)  lighting up a cigar. That person obviously overlooked the entire movie over the fact that Churchill did smoke cigars, often. Anyway... I digress.If Oldman does not win the Oscar for best actor for his portrayal, I might just have to quit watching movies (which would make me very sad). His performance was so stunning. There was never a time during the film that I didn't think I wasn't watching the actual Winston Churchill. Just the mannerisms, posture, detail to the voice of Churchill, Oldman's portrayal was perfection. The outstanding makeup only added to Oldman's performance.I did read some reviews that said this movie was completely historically inaccurate. My response to that is: A) it's not a documentary, and B) the major points were accurate. My husband is an avid student of WWII history, and he felt the movie was phenomenal. It's Hollywood, they are going to dramatize things. If you want complete historical accuracy, watch a documentary.The cinematography was very interesting. It matches the movie's title poster. Very lighted on Winston, but a feeling of a vignette of darkness around him. Sometimes the effect was softer, and others it was very sharp and contrasting. I felt this added some emotional depth to the movie, and added some insight to how isolated he felt during his first days as PM.I am probably going to watch The King's Speech, Darkest Hour and Dunkirk in that order on the same day...","5.0 "

The Darkest Hour may not be a factual, moment by moment account of what took place in those critical few days before the British people in their little boats managed to pull off one of the most unbelievable rescues of all time, but it sure has all the rich detail one would expect to read about in the most authoritative historical account. The only thing missing IMHO, were young people in the theater, who apparently find the pure fiction of the latest 'Star Wars' episode more appealing.

When, several minutes into this film, I  watched a closeup of Gary Oldman's portrayal in giving one of Churchill's speeches ... Oldman BECAME Churchill right before my eyes!  A marvelous performance.  The reality was there, the sincerity and believability of that day-and-time were convincingly genuine.  I doubt some of the scenes depicted actually took place in real life, but they all lent themselves well to the core of the story, and the magnificence of Sir Winston Churchill.  In all the annals of time, never have I read of any such perfectly timed, perfectly prepared, group of men who came together at the right time, in the right places to defend the world against evil as they did in World War 2 - and Sir Winston Churchill was one of those men.  The movie is of the ""must see"" category - especially if one is interested in statesmanship.","5.0 "
"Darkest Hour","Watch it for Gary Oldman's out of this world performance","Paul Allaer","""Darkest Hour"" (2017 release; 125 min.) is a movie about Winston's Churchill's initial month in office. As the movie opens. we are reminded it is ""9 May 1940"", with the Nazi's about to run over Holland and Belgium, and the UK looking for a new leader following Chamberlain. We get to know Churchill: working from his bed, with a stiff drink, and almost scaring away his new secretary (because she typed single-spaced). While certainly not revered by his colleagues (and oven less by King George), Winston Churchill nevertheless get his lifelong dream fulfilled and is named Prime Minister on May 10th. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from British director Joe Wright, whose  previous work includes the fine 2012 remake of ""Anna Karenina"". Here, working from a script by Anthony McCarten, we get a close look at Churchill in his early days as Prime Minister. The movie covers the period of May 9-28, 1940, so this by no means meant as a definitive bio-pick f the life and times of Winston Churchill, who had an amazing and long political career, spanning 5 decades. If you hope to learn anything about Churchill's personal life, then this movie is definitely not for you (his wife Clementine appears in some scenes, and their grown-up kids in exactly 1 scene). If on the other hand you are curious how Churchill ran his War Cabinet or how Churchill dealt with King George, then this movie is very much for you. I have no idea whether all of what we see on the big screen actually happened or not (did Churchill really take that subway ride to be ""among the British people""?), but the narrative is certainly there. And there there is Gary Oldman, in the role of his life as Winston Churchill. Oldman is virtually unrecognizable under all of the heavy makeup, and instead it is as if we see Churchill in the flesh. A role like this in a movie like this, is sure to generate a LOT of nominations in the upcoming awards season (Oldman was already nominated for the Golden Globes). Comments Churchill's wife at one point: ""You are wise because you have doubts"", and that about sums it up. It's apparently very lonely at the top, and riddled ith doubts. WHat a job Churchill did under the most demanding of circumstances. Last but certainly not least, as I was watching this movie, it feels like the other side of the coin to ""Dunkirk"", a very different movie obviously, but covering some of the same historical ground and facts. ""Darkest Hour"" is also far better than the weak ""Churchill"" movie from earlier this year (starring Brian Cox).""Darkest Hours"" opened on 4 screens this weekend here in Cincinnati. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at (in a fairly large theater) was absolutely jam-packed to the rafters, much to my surprise. Looks like there is a large appetite for this type of historical drama. I encourage you to check out ""Darkest Hour"", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","4.0 "

"Darkest Hour","Historical drama at its best with an award worthy performance by Gary Oldman","M. Oleson","Theater review.  Possible spoilers.  It what seems like normalcy these days, this is another film that focuses on the events of World War II.  In this case, specifically Winston Churchill’s (“Churchill” and “Dunkirk”) role as well as the Dunkirk rescue.  Interestingly, the director here, Joe Wright also directed “Atonement” from 2007 which also had scenes from the Dunkirk battle.This film is an eye-opening look at how Churchill (remarkable performance by Gary Oldman) replaced Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) of his own Conservative Party.  Certainly controversial yet Parliament was splitting as the ever-encroaching Nazi war machine was closing in on England after all but swallowing up mainland Europe.  Chamberlain had appeased Hitler and remained hopeful of a negotiated peace.  Churchill had warned for years that the Reich would never be placated.  He was right of course but the government continued to argue.The film lacks action sequences other than the sometimes bitter discourse between Churchill and Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane), an ally of Chamberlain.  Wright assembled a great supporting cast.  Ben Mendelsohn plays King George VI, who is someone suspicious of Churchill but comes to support him when push comes to shove.  Churchill’s wife Clemmie is played by Kristin Scott Thomas.  Lily James plays Elizabeth Layton, Churchill’s personal secretary.While I’m no historian, Churchill’s ability to listen to the people regarding acquiescing to Hitler or fighting is instrumental in his decision.  In the film, this awareness is limited to an engagement with a few riders on the “tube” (subway).  Sharply focused yet brief.  The key here is Oldman’s transformation into the great leader.  Assisted by seemingly pounds of make-up and prosthetics, he captures the essence of Churchill; at least based on the numerous historical images I’ve seen.  The direction, photography and the set pieces are perfect as well.  Look for some Oscar noms coming, certainly for Oldman.  Recommended.","4.0 "

So this one fits nicely into the middle of the collection. However, there was a lot I did not know about those first days of him in office. I was surprised that Neville Chamberlain was still being listened to after his disastrous agreement with Hitler. And I was impressed with King George. Gary Oldman, of course deserves the Oscar for best actor. He entirely disappears into his character. But all the other actors were superb as well. Kristin Scott Thomas is a wonderful Clemmie.

"Darkest Hour","A film outdone by its main performance, but fine work nonetheless.","FourLightYears","There have been a LOT of representations of Winston Churchill lately--Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson, John Lithgow (to names the ones I can think of just off the top of my head)--Gary Oldman's portrayal is probably the best because he really had to inhabit the character, which he did a remarkable job of doing. I did not see any aspect of Gary Oldman the actor on the screen. That said, Brendan Gleeson has the best natural look to play Churchill. Unfortunately, the Academy weighs heavily to what degree an actor changes his or her appearance to give a good performance, or what harrowing and/or gruesome things the actor is willing to do for the sake of the performance (consider Charlize Theron in Monster, Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull, Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot, Leonardo DiCaprio in The Revenant, Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyers Club, and Jared Leto, supporting actor, in the same movie, Adrian Brody in The Pianist, Nicole Kidman in The Hours...). I'm not saying that's always the case but, actors seem to get extra points for it. If anyone were to win on those merits alone, Oldman would have a lock, because I have never seen such a convincing performance through appearance-modificationAs for the film. It was good. But it is one of those films in which the performance is better than the film. Both are excellent, but Oldman raises the film to a level it might not otherwise have reached, like Daniel Day-Lewis did for There Will be Blood (which, while being a remarkable film in every way, boasted a performance for the ages from Day-Lewis).This script in Darkest Hour is a little clumsy in places, and doesn't give you enough context in places. The ""Miracle at Dunkirk"" was a truly astonishing moment in history, but we don't really get to see how it came to be considered ""a miracle.""One unfortunate aspect of the disc occurs in the special features, when the director says the film is somewhat prescient in its message. One might think he is referring to a growth in Russian aggression, North Korea, totalitarian regimes in the Middle-East, or perhaps terror attacks all over Europe. But no, to him, the threat is ""right wing populism"" sweeping through Europe and the United States. ""We will fight them on the beaches, in the air, on land, in the water, in the streets."" To the director, conservative or right wing politics is what we must rise up and fight against in the streets. It was absolutely inane, and I could hardly believe my ears when I heard it. What a disappointment.","4.0 "
"Darkest Hour","Two Excellent Films Look At The Same Events From Different Angles","Mark D. Prouse","As someone interested in history, but who is not a scholar, I decided to do a bit of homework before watching the movies Dunkirk (2017) (BD) [Blu-ray] and Darkest Hour.  I looked them up on the Internet, using resources like Wikipedia to simply get the gist of what was going on, historically, so I might better grasp the dramatizations created in the two movies.  I watched Dunkirk first, and Darkest Hour a few days later.Because I was so bowled over by both movies, I can confidently recommend that these films be watched back to back, because they cover the same period, both specifically (Dunkirk – one event) and generally (Darkest Hour – about a nation’s resolve, leading into the war years). Conversely, the action of Dunkirk is seen through the eyes of an “everyman” character, a soldier among many soldiers, sailors and airmen, mostly nameless, but who made up the forces, which eventually helped England, defend itself from Hitler’s massive assault machine during World War II. Because they had been successfully evacuated from the encircled Dunkirk, British forces were able to regroup and come back stronger. Had this event not occurred, they might have been largely wiped out, and the war could have had an entirely different and deeply tragic conclusion.Meanwhile, Darkest Hour takes up the story from the perspective of Winston Churchill, portrayed brilliantly by Gary Oldman, who deservedly won the 2017 Best Actor Oscar for this film, along with his wife, his young secretary, members of the British Parliament, and even the King.Dunkirk is a mesmerizing and relentless portrayal of a turning point in a battle that was very nearly lost.  In case readers here want to be kept in suspense, I won’t reveal its climactic moments, but this same time in history is briefly visualized in Darkest Hour.  Both films have incredibly moving sequences.  The aerial dogfights in Dunkirk were made real by the filmmakers’ refusal to turn them into some kind of Star Wars, breakneck-speed fest. It’s clear by the fine details that these airmen were working with technology quite primitive by today’s standards. Because we are invited into their cockpits through the use of beautifully calculated camera close-ups, their heroism becomes palpable, and we sweat and grit our teeth and hold on to our seats as if we were in there with them.  Two scenes in the final half hour of Dunkirk may resonate with some viewers long after the movie is over. They did me, not to mention the breathtaking cinematography (shots of the beaches from the air, with thousands of men lined up to be rescued while the Germans continued their bombing raids, are among the most memorable scenes in the movie).While Dunkirk is saturated in tones of aqua, blue, pale yellow, green and white, Darkest Hour uses warm browns and sepias, with accents of red, orange, navy blue and beige.  It is another animal entirely, but is a perfect counterpoint, dramatically and emotionally, to Dunkirk.  Churchill, I learned from my research, was a tremendously complex individual, with a history of both failures and successes in various leadership roles.  He had detractors as well as champions.  While other portions of his life and career apparently revealed him as a deeply flawed human being, what Darkest Hour makes clear is that he was a tremendous communicator, and it was much to his credit that England did not surrender, but fought to the bitter end, and with the help of its allies, arose triumphant.  Now I’m not knowledgeable enough to speculate that the British Empire would have triumphed over the Nazis if America had not finally been sucked into the war. But Darkest Hour pulls out all the emotional stops as it races toward its conclusion, and I was left with both tears and renewed astonishment at the fortitude of a small nation’s resilience, sacrifice and determination – all foreshadowed in the speeches of Winston Churchill.  Darkest Hour is not an action film, and yet compared to Dunkirk, it seems to be over much, much faster. Personally, I attribute this to the extraordinary Gary Oldman.  This is surely his finest hour on the Big Screen!Each of these two movies is stronger, I think, because of the existence of the other.  The prime message that I took from this pair of fine films was not so much some notion of the “glory of war,” but just how valuable and hard won is the peace.  During World War II, Hollywood movies seem to have been created as rallying cries to the battlefield and to victory, with manly men proudly marching into danger and destruction, and sturdy women working in the factories and keeping “the home fires burning” – and these entertainments often fulfilled their purpose.  Dunkirk and Darkest Hour accomplish something a bit different – to remind us of the necessity of shared sacrifice, so important when the world faced down the “Great Dictator,” but which seems almost like a foreign, impossible concept now.  I don’t see any leaders today who have the strength of character of a Winston Churchill, who can help us put aside our petty differences and to see ourselves as a nation with common goals, a society capable of achieving some kind of unity while remaining free.  Woe to us if we ever have to face another Hitler!","5.0 "

Yes, he regretted Gallipoli, but his self-confidence was utterly unshakable. After all, he's the man who said, ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""The movie's failure to capture Churchill's humor is inexcusable in my mind. For instance, here's one of the ""jokes"" from the movie that went something like this: ""What, haven't you ever seen the prime minister on the subway before?"" That's not a joke, that's an insult to Churchill. What makes this worse is that the screenwriters didn't need to write anything themselves, because Churchill wrote or spoke it himself.

The scenes between Churchill, Lord Halifax, and Chamberlain are particularly excellent. And, the  King and Churchill are memorable. Churchill drank from morning til night, and we wonder how this man could have been so brilliant. His wife, Clementine or Clemmie as he called her played by Kristin Scott Thomas, is quite poignant. Their love for each other quite apparent. We meet his children, and observe his over powering presence and absence from their lives.

Mention is made of Churchill's prior defeats (Gallipoli and India) and the implication is clear that he was not altogether trusted for judgment and clarity of thinking.  He was also something of an alcoholic and cigar smoker who lived to the amazing age of 90.  In 1940, he was 66.  He was the right man at the right time and is rightly credited with saving Europe and the World from the Nazi scourge --- but it was by no means a clear cut thing at the time.  ---  The Churchill ride in the underground is almost certainly cinematic invention and the very idea of Churchill remaining seated when the King visited him in his offices and is walking around is almost heretically wrong.  Churchill would never have sat in the presence of while the Sovereign was standing up.  Churchill was ""more royalist than the King"".  However, great acting and directing and writing captures a critical moment in history with powerful if not complete accuracy.","5.0 "

Sad they gave the award to a movie that celebrates beastiality, rather than human courage. No wonder the theaters are empty these days.

"Darkest Hour","Outstanding Film / Coarse, Eloquent, Overbearing, Self-Doubting, Hard as Nails, Soft as a Baby, Oldman’s Churchill Comes to Life","New Orleans gal","For those into great character studies, and not war flicks, this is so much the former. At the same time, it lays out clearly and understandably the path of Churchill’s gravely complex decision-making, vis-a-vis taking on Nazi Germany, who by 1940 was a military monster, with Britain next on its expanding menu.  What a super script (Anthony McCarten), directed to excellence by Joe Wright!  The humor is wonderfully witty. The score is congruent and beautiful, the cinematography and editing by Bruno Dubonnel and Valerio Bonelli, respectively, pure art.  Forgive the flurry of superlatives, but it’s all that good. The diversity of wisely-chosen, storyline-enhancing angles and smart imagery are impressive, as are the just-right atmospheric lighting and ambient sound. Now for the acting— Gary Oldman is sensational!  He portrays the extremes of Churchill’s personality and behaviors exquisitely, from barking orders from atop the privy, to tearing up over someone’s loss, to stumbling over words or unable to speak when distressed, to delivering rare and historical oratory.  The whole cast is top-notch. Kristin Scott Thomas is a great Clemmie, and special applause for Lily James as Elizabeth Layton, Churchill’s secretary, whose body language, as much as her spoken lines, attests to her fine talent.  An impressive film. Highly recommend!","5.0 "

"Darkest Hour","The Man of the Darkest Hour","Daniel C. Cunningham","A stirring rennactment of the drama around the survival of Britain at the start of the WWII. I thought the casting was great and the portrayal of Winston Churchill - with his foibles and weaknesses along with his bulldog British stubbornness and resolve to go on and never give up - was accurate..  I have no love for the English - being of Irish descent - but I have great respect for the British nation for their courage and resiliance during the terror of those days.  My father was a tank sergeant in the Canadian army in that great war. He used to tell me stories about that time and he clearly thought that Churchill was a great man and that without Churchill in command England would surely have gone down.I would not have wanted to make the decision to sacrifice the garrison at Calais - in order to give the Allied army at chance to evacuate at Dunkirk. But Churchill made the call and took the heat. The movie also and showed the shocking courage of the British people to cross the channel in those small boats to evacuate the 300,000. This was  IMHO a magnificent act. It certainly shocked Hitler and the British military high command -  military people who could not have imagined that the civilian population could have risen to such a challenge when, militarily there was no way out.And it would not have happened if Churchill had not given the order.The scene with Winston Churchill on the ""underground"" with the common British subjects was striking. I don't know if it was real or just a mental aberration of the directors and screen writers to impress naive idealistic people like me - but it worked. It strengthened the impression that I already had of the humility of Churchill and resolve of the people that he served.Indeed I think I understand better what it was that transformed the apparently defeated British nation into a dedicated, united, courageous nation - a nation that would need that courage and resolve to make it through the next five years of hardship to ultimate victory.And that transformation happened during that dark May of 1940. I think Churchill, with his faults was the man of the darkest hour.","5.0 "
"Darkest Hour","We Will Never Surrender!","Vicki Hopkins","To give this film anything less than five kernels or five glowing stars, would be a travesty.  A very short period of history from May 8, 1940 to June 4, 1940 is portrayed on screen.  It focuses on the stubborn and determined man who refused to surrender and those who loved and hated him.I don’t think I’ve seen a movie that has roused me to such patriotism even though I was born in the USA.  Perhaps it is my ancestral roots in England and the fact that my second great uncle once introduced Churchill at a meeting when he was a young conservative just elected in Manchester.  Whatever the reason, I felt profoundly moved.The movie begins with the House of Commons calling for the resignation of Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister due to his handling of the war.  Even though he wasn’t their first choice as a replacement, Churchill fills the position and even the King isn’t too keen to see him as Prime Minister. After accepting the position, he displays a much different view as to how Hitler should be handled. He organizes his war cabinet but soon discovers not many of them have the stomach for war and lean toward the idea of negotiating a peace settlement with Hitler.  Churchill balks at the idea but receives mounting pressure to agree or face being replaced.At this point, I could kick myself that after two trips to London, having not visited the Churchill War Rooms after seeing this movie where much of it takes place.  Joining the cast of characters and giving strong support is Kristin Scott Thomas who plays Churchill’s wife and Lily James who plays Elizabeth his newly hired secretary.One focused event is how Churchill came up with the idea on how to rescue the majority of British forces stranded at Dunkirk.  Later on, when faced with the decision to negotiate or stand firm, he takes the pulse of the common Londoner to see if they would rather surrender or fight.  Then he goes to Parliament to deliver his famous speech laced with the words below.  At the very end, he storms through the doors and the movie ends, making you wish you could jump to your feet and fight the war in the streets by his side.  At the end, I shudder to think what would have happened had Churchhill not roused England to stand firm.Gary Oldman’s performance is so brilliant that mere wordy accolades are not enough. His transformation from the man he is in real life into Churchill in looks and mannerisms is astounding.  It's a no-brainer that he walked away with the Golden Globe, SAG, BAFTA, and Oscar.","5.0 "
"Darkest Hour","A Fine DVD effort, and Magnificent Oldman -- But it also proves that it was, indeed, the pictures that got small","Bruce Eder","There's nothing ""wrong"" with the Universal DVD of DARKEST HOUR -- it's a pretty good transfer of a superb movie, with some helpful extras and an easy to utilize menu allowing access to it all. In that regard, the makers have done a competent job within the limits of the format. But, and this is a big ""but,"" having seen DARKEST HOUR three times in a theater during its theatrical run, it just isn't the same, and can never be the same. Watching Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill here is still a rewarding experience, but this is a case where more is distinctly MORE, and a 40- or 50-foot-wide screen is the way to see this piece presented properly. I know that's a criticism that can be made of almost any movie presented in a home-viewing format, but it is very glaring here, as my first experience of the movie was theatrical. What Norma Desmond says in SUNSET BOULEVARD was never more evident than it was watching this DVD -- it was, indeed, the pictures that got small.","4.0 "

I've read other books on Churchill, listened to his speeches and film clips; this movie misses more than it hits.  There are several Darkest Hour fact checking websites dealing with the accuracy of the events, timelines, relationships, and characters' personalities; they also found the movie interesting but lacking.  For instance Churchill's famous ""We shall fight them on the beaches"" speech was made six days after the rescue of the troops from Dunkirk, not before.  His confidence came because England had received back 300,000 of her troops and not merely hopeful but empty bravado.  The idea of using private vessels to help rescue soldiers was not originally Churchill's; the Admiralty had the idea and preparations in place weeks ahead of the event.  Don't prep for a history test based on this movie.","3.0 "

While facing imminent defeat at the hands of the odious Nazis in France and defeatist politicians in the corridors of Parliament, England's new Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, gropes for the proper course of action. Braced by a fine supporting cast and a fast-paced script, Gary Oldman provides the performance of his lifetime. Reminiscent of Daniel Day-Lewis in his role as Lincoln, Oldman bears the additional burden of portraying a great leader, whom most of us have seen on film. His performance is far more than patterns of speech or make-up. He finds the man's soul and his underlying humanity.

Sir Winston was not the most popular choice of the members of Parliament, owing to his legendary image as a war monger and risk taker, as many of his fellow MPs were still steeped in appeasement to Adolph Hitler.

It’s that good !  It enscapulates the Churchill literature and humanizes him.  Artistic license with the Undergtound excursion, embodying the British nation’s spirit to defy Hitler and the Nazi scourge,highlights resolution and resolve, surmounts and epitomizes solidarity of a leader and his people.  Brilliant.  Unforgettable.  Grab it !","5.0 "

Other than that The Washington Post said it portrayed him favorably so there must be some truth in it. That and lets face it, if Chamberlain was allowed to stay Prime Minister then England would be speaking German and running the Federal Reserve.","5.0 "

"Darkest Hour","Enjoyable film about Churchill’s Finest Hour","David Lindsay","I  enjoyed the movie. Most historical films make things up. I have read a couple of biographies of Churchill and the film is mostly historically accurate. It covers a two week period during May 1940. Churchill is appointed prime minister and the war is about to be lost. France is on its last legs and the rest of mainland Europe is under the control of Germany and its allies.Only Britain is left standing. The British army is trapped on a beach at Dunkirk in France. The film shows Churchill organizing the evacuation and rallying the country to fight on. Churchill has to battle the leaders of his own party who want a negotiated peace with Hitler.The story is well told and the acting is excellent. Gary Oldman is in virtually every scene and is convincing as Churchill. The film is mostly concerned with internal British politics, however, President Roosevelt is shown turning down Churchill’s request for military equipment. If you are interested in World War Two the film is worth watching. Joe Wright who directed 'Atonement' and 'Pride & Predudice' does a good job capturing the period detail.","5.0 "

While that obviously sounds harsh, I meant it that way.  I have been reviewing a lot of information on WWII lately and really looked forward to this film about Churchill because it received such rave reviews.  After watching it, I don't understand why.  The best Churchill I have seen performed was by John Lithgow and did not resort to what seems more of a caricature than a character study.  Churchill was a great man for many years before WWII and many years after.  His strength and determination were responsible for keeping Britain out of negotiations with the monstrous Hitler which negoatiations would have had disastrous results.  This film captures one of Churchill's great speeches but there was so much more to him that is ignored and/or ridiculed by this film","2.0 "

But keep in mind you're only watching a sliver of the momentous accomplishments of the great Winston Churchill.  This is NOT a biography piece.  You're simply watching the few weeks or months leading to Churchill's ascension to Prime Minister (which is like the first 10 minutes of the movie) and preparation leading to the successful mission at Dunkirk.  So don't expect a wide spanning biopic or a study of his actions through the course of the war.  I think that's gonna take a few sequels.","4.0 "

"Darkest Hour","A movie that burns at the same rate as Churchill's cigar.","penname","***First a note on the quality of the instant video playback.--- The first quarter of the film the playback was running at a lagging pace and scenes moved slower than audio, While I considered it could be my connection - I had no doubt it was the fault on Amazon's side later on in the film as a scene moved in fast forward away from the audio. I hope they fix that problem and I will follow up on it****Quick story recap:  Churchill as newly appointed Prime Minister must overcome the difficult task of managing a war effort near failure amidst internal fighting among his war cabinet to surrender or to fight the Nazi'sActing of Gary Oldman is superb as per his knack for completely disappearing into characters.  His every physical move, voice utterance on point and calculated to pull off an excellent acting job.  Everyone else does well of course but he steals the show and obviously he should because this whole film is his character's story.Overall as a film, this movie is a slow burn.  I think it's good and I enjoyed it.  The rousing speeches had an effect upon me as a viewer.  I was ready to fight for the British cause.  This movie is Dunkirk's counterpart told from a different angle which in and of itself is worth watching both movies.  But just like Dunkirk, great story but doesn't make the best film.  It feels like the story needs to continue on to the fight following the final speech.  It gets the parliament and thus the audience built up and ready for battle and then the credits roll as Churchill exits parliament leaving at least myself begging for more to want to see the British fight back.  So I'd give this movie somewhere in the 3 to 4 range 3.5 to be fair.  It's good, It does the job, But the only reason I'd watch it again would be to study and enjoy Gary Oldman's performance.  Good speeches and tension that slowly builds but I'm not overly in love with it in it's entirety.","3.0 "

Next time I will go to YouTube and look up an old PBSspecial on Churchill or better read a book.","2.0 "
"Darkest Hour","Gary Oldman gives the best male performance I’ve seen this entire year","Christopher Schwinger","Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill is the very best performance by a male actor I’ve seen all year.  Joe Wright, the director, has such amazing visual imagination in the way the shots are filmed in this also.  He is as visually creative in directing this movie as Steven Spielberg.  The entire movie takes place in the month of May 1940, beginning with Neville Chamberlain’s ousting from Prime Ministership and ending with the successful evacuation from Dunkirk.  I had no idea how alone Churchill was in insisting on no negotiation with Hitler.  The movie is what I’d call flawless—intense because you’re right in the middle of the daily relationships and decisions which the difficult personality of Winston Churchill dealt with, but also consciously including meaningful moments of how Churchill’s wife is affected by the ordeals.  There’s perfect emotional contrast.  The only other movie I’ve seen which can make an intense political drama in dimly lit rooms so constantly engaging is Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln”.  I think Gary Oldman should get the Oscar, just as Daniel Day-Lewis did for Lincoln.  I like Brian Cox’s Churchill in the movie “Churchill” earlier this year about the reservations he had about the Normandy beach invasion.  But this film just is more of an artistic masterpiece with maybe a little more breadth to the character of Churchill.  This deserves the title of “masterpiece” for how flawless it is.","5.0 "

Previously, I never paid much attention to Gary Oldman as an actor, but if his performance in ""Darkest Hour"" fails to win an Oscar, it would have to be because of some ""politically correct"" pressure.

"Darkest Hour","Some goods and some bads.","Fedoradude","Makes some good points about the diversity of opinion in Churchill's war cabinet and that he'd surrounded himself with rivals on purpose. The acting is done well and the scenes and costumes help the viewer to feel immersed in the scene along with the players.I think a few other actors who've played Churchill in WW2 movies make better Churchill's. Also, the purely contrived scenes like the subway visitation with the citizens of London inspiring him knocked a star off the rating too.

Amazing how close the Conservative party in England was with the Republican Party in the US in that both wanted to make a peace deal with Hitler. Of course Hitler would have invaded eventually as he did with Russia after the deal he made with them. Luckily Churchill was willing to stand up to his party members and demand England fight. I do wish the movie had gone on to cover a little more of WW2 but that would have made the movie way too long.

The political actions of his cabinet members were interesting but shallow and I'm sure if historically correct.  The movie was to brief.  Both in the historical coverage of the early stages of the war.  Including the fall of Europe, especially the Low Countries and France.  And the military personnel, equipment, and resource problems he faced.  Maybe a more comprehensive sequel of the later war stages and his involvement and interactions with Roosevelt, Stalin, DeGaul, and Eisenhower.","4.0 "

"Darkest Hour","SHOULD BE REQUIRED VIEWING...BEFORE DUNKIRK!","MRD","Franklin Delano Roosevelt observed that Winston Churchill was probably the most important person on earth at the time of World War II. Others guess that, without Churchill, the Nazi swastika would be flying over England and much of Europe to this day. Little wonder that we keep making films and writing books about him.Some have said that this movie is just a ""Let's give Oldman the Oscar he deserves” movie. Hardly! But, should Oldman not win an Oscar for this one it will be by far the worst of the many mistakes made by the Academy over its arguably controversial existence!But to the movie and to my headline.Those initial darkest hours for Churchill and for England revolved, in large measure, around the dire situation that was unfolding just across the Channel. Now, I made the mistake of watching Dunkirk before watching Darkest Hour. Not a huge problem for me because, being a dedicated Churchill aficionado, I knew the history well enough to fill in the many historic holes that, unfortunately, characterized Dunkirk. Probably the most offensive aspect of Dunkirk comes when Churchill is mentioned as a mere aside; his speech is read in a newspaper by one of the returning soldiers. Laughable! Taking Churchill out of the Dunkirk history is like an account of the crossing of the Delaware without Washington! Two of my sons watched Dunkirk with me and then went and watched Darkest Hour with me later on. When I asked them whether Dunkirk made more sense now, their response was an enthusiastic “Absolutely!”Oldman is exquisitely masterful as Churchill. Period. I had to laugh at one reviewer’s observation that it was all make-up. Of course it was, just as John Hurt’s astounding portrayal of the Elephant Man was! Compared to the many portrayals of Churchill over the years (by Albert Finney, The Gathering Storm; Brian Cox, Churchill; Brendan Gleeson, Into the Storm; and, Timothy Spall, The King’s Speech) Oldman’s is — in my opinion — the best and most believable.And, regarding the much-criticized scene in the London subway: it is a historic fact that Churchill spent time on the streets of London talking to the common people. It gave the people hope. Did he ever go down into the subway and hold court as he did in the movie? Does it really matter?! The scene, in my view, was scripted exceptionally and added a sense of Churchill’s human concerns that surely were characteristic.THE HORSEMAN","5.0 "

"Darkest Hour","Epic Drama: among the best in any year","Dennis, was at Holy Apostles","All of us can think of movies that won Best Picture merely by squeaking past their year's competition. Joe Wright's ""Darkest Hour"" would be a strong contender in any year. And just as Daniel Day-Lewis gave us Lincoln, Gary Oldman gives us Churchill. A splendid performance about a controversial leader. Churchill famously defined Russia as ""a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma."" Yet, he himself was an enigma: part W.C. Fields, part Trump, and God only knows who else. He was reviled by his colleagues in Parliament and King George VI initially had grave concerns about his judgment and grip on reality. After all, as First Lord of the Admiralty early in World War I, Churchill insisted on the Gallipoli Campaign, which ended in disaster. He was given no more chances (until Dunkirk in 1940), but was forced to resign in disgrace to a 25-year political purgatory. By grit and forbearance, he outlasted his detractors and was raised from the dust bin by King George to lead Britain through what was to become its ""Darkest Hour."" Oldman nails this episode in Churchill's life that also is illuminated by actresses Lily James (Rose in ""Downton Abbey,"" ""Cinderella""), as his secretary, and Kristin Scott Thomas, as his wife, Clementine. Fine performances all.","5.0 "

"Darkest Hour","Hollywood does Churchill!!!","Redhead","so many issues i have with this Hollywood version of Churchill. first just his physical presentation by olman is churchill of the 50's and 60's NOT 1940. didn't anyone look a photographs of churchill of 1940? He did not look as old as they made oldman up to be and he was no way near that heavy, not at least until the 1950's. but MOST importantly, if anyone ever studied churchill or knew him should well know that he NEVER ever second guessed himself. he was enormously self assured and certainly ""cock"" sure. so to portray that he seriously decided to negotiate for surrender terms via el duca is absurd! in his meeting with chamberlain he lied to him to put him off the trail of removing him from his new appointment as PM by saying he ""MIGHT"" consider those options. but anyone who has wrote about churchill, that  was NOT an opponent (such as his rivals in his own party like chamberlin), said that he NEVER seriously considered surrender prior to dunkurk or at any time during the war. yet this movie on two occasions has him say those words to clem and his king! only chamberlin and norfork had him saying that becasue they wanted to bring him down to their cowardly level so that churchill's image in history will lose some of its luster. chamberlin and norfork willing would have handed the keys to the kingdom so to assure the safe position of the landed/titled class in england under a nazi controlled england. many of the ""gentry"" during the 30's were pro nazi. chamberlin's name should be synonyms with quisling. both acted treasonous towards their countries. but the over all image of churchill in this movie looked to me to be a deliberate attempt to highlight all of american historians version of churchill as an over ambitious, bumblimg, egomaniac who was always drunk! imagine how some such as that could possible out smart and defeat nazi germany??? churchill did drink around the clock, but did it stop him from accomplishing his amazing leadership. unlike einshower, and mccauthur, churchill did not have a ""shadow"" whispering in his ear all his great ideas in order to make him look good. this certainly was the case for old ike and ol duggi because neither one of those american ""heros"" were competent to tie their shoes or write an intelligible sentence! i admit that churchill had some crazy ideas at times but also lots of genius as well. he was human not a super hero! but america always has to downplay englands efforts and contributions in ww11 (i.e.: churchill) after all america can only shine when all (or who) else are dulled?! in 1940 chruchill was in his prim and in his element. he was brillant and had to deal with the cunning and underhanded two-faced dealings of FDR. FDR is personally responsible for 40+ years of cold war with the ussr because of his selling out to stalin at every turn during the war. and he did this to deliberately tear apart the british empire so that america could pick up all her over seas holdings. so FDR sold out all of europe to stalin and deliberatly prolonged the war to make everyone else as weak as possible so that america would end up the big big winner and he didn't give a rats ass for what stalin did to europe or to china. when will the truth of FR be told? and the funny thing is churchill absolutely knew that game fdr was playing him for and he actually admired him even more for it simply because he would if he could have played the exact same cutthroat game if the tables were turned! yet in all of churhills writings he never wrote an ill word against fdr! not one! and knowing the hundreds of thousands of lives needlessly lost due to the game fdr played for power and empire! So how about it england, when is someone over there going to spill the beans on fdr during ww11??? i think it would be absolute about time if not certainly DUE TIME!","1.0 "
"Darkest Hour","Subtitles might have helped","SPB","I was looking forward to seeing this movie in a big way, and wound up disappointed and sitting through it to the very end, hoping it would get better. It did not. Churchill's portrayal was neither sympathetic nor unsympathetic— merely a charicature of a mumbly old man who could put away an admirable amount of booze. There was no hint of the brilliant and charismatic statesman we knew him to be, other than hearing his wife, Clementine, say so. Granted, I may have missed something while straining to decipher Mr. Oldman’s mostly-unintelligible speech given through the artful artificial jowls. I kept wondering whether or not he had also stuffed cotton inside his cheeks à la The Godfather.  BTW, Churchill’s actual recorded speeches were more intelligible. I checked.","1.0 "
"Darkest Hour","An also ran movie....","pj","While Gary Oldman is one of my favorite actors, this movie left me feeling very unimpressed. I have read much of this great man's life (WSC) and some of what is in this movie simply did not happen, and was put in, I assume, under what I can only say was a liberal use of ""poetic license"", which is always very dangerous when dealing with matters of historical importance. The relationship between WSC and his adored wife ""Clemmy"" is not accurately portrayed, and the internal doubt displayed by WSC is very much overstated in this movie. Also, this movie lacks one thing that other great movies always have, and that is a great musical score. The score was instantly forgettable and without any merit whatsoever in my book. I simply cannot see this getting any Oscars, (except perhaps costume) based upon the merits of the movie and not political internal whims of the movie academy. There are far greater WSC movies out there which cover very accurately what this historical period was about, including the great man himself. This particular rendition, while watchable is like a cigar without a whiskey...missing something!","3.0 "

"Darkest Hour","Playing Loose With Winston Churchill's Personality","BrandonSanFran","Not the Winston Churchill historians already know about this great man. His flaws and greatness has been done in better ways. Take the 2002, The Gathering Storm starred by the great Albert Finney, co produced by BBC and NBC, that was the greatest Churchill in film. The other one not so bad either and still better than Darkest Hour was Into the Storm with Brendan Gleeson.Darkest Hour would be OK for those who know nothing of the man or history. For example, the subway scene where Churchill rides the train for the first time and communicate with the ordinary citizen and asking their views, that was silly. Churchill was anti fascist and anti Hitler, he already knew how evil it was. He didn't need or want opinions. That was why he was hated by the opposition and his own party. They thought he was a warmonger. He was a small number that was right before Hitler started his take over of countries. Just like Churchill, Eisenhower's hands were tied because popular views was against war. Eisenhower had to deal with laws made to make sure America would not join or help the British, he too was called a warmonger and even some wanted to impeach the President. So, adding the subway scene was plain silliness. Winston Churchill did not waver in his total defense of Britain. He wasn't a socialist that would have weakness in defending his nation.","3.0 "

"Darkest Hour","Oldman brings Churchill to life","Connie (She who hikes with dogs)","Of the various World War II movies that came out in 2017, this, by far, is the best.  Gary Oldman is unrecognizable as Winston Churchill.  His mannerisms, his pout, his constant chewing on a cigar, his frequent sips of whisky, but also his well-known angry outbursts all come to life in this two-hour movie.Other actors help bring reality to this historical dramatization.  Kristin Scott Thomas plays Clemmie, his patient, calm and supportive wife; Ben Mendelsohn plays King George VI, a supportive but worried monarch; Stephen Dillane plays a very believable Viscount Halifax, a still skeptical Foreign Secretary (with whom some of the best dialogue appears at the half-way point of this movie); Ronald Pickup plays Neville Chamberlain, and Lily James plays Ms Elizabeth Layton, Churchill's wartime secretary who witnessed so many of Churchill's outburst yet stayed by his side.The Darkest Hour is not an action-packed war movie.  This film goes behind the scenes of events from 9 May through the end of the month.  Chamberlain resigns on May 10th and Churchill is appointed Prime Minister.  He takes on the total opposite of Chamberlain's willingness of appeasement toward Hitler.  Churchill is not about to back off, but he is aware that England is not quite ready to go to war with Germany.  In fact, he insists on bringing in ships to safely evacuate his surrounded troops around Dunkirk, France.  His War Cabinet and the King have their doubts about Churchill, and many scenes show the discontent of what to do.  They worried that Churchill would anger the English with his arrogance.  He instead riled his people in support of war and standing up to the Nazis.Churchill is definitely portrayed with all his flaws, and that is what makes him so humane. Kirsten Scott Thomas as Clemmie also is aware of his flaws.  ""You are insufferable!"" she screams at him, then asks him""How much have you had to drink this morning?"" as Churchill declares his love for her.There are a lot of dark, smoky scenes all throughout, followed by loud outbreaks by Churchill.  He is shown as impatient, rude at times, condescending toward his opponents, troubled by self-doubt.  In moments of tenderness however, he will also look lovingly at his wife, give his pet corgi some meat off his dinner plate, or kneel on the floor to look under the bed to make sure his cat is eating its meal.Churchill is known to have suffered from bouts of depression which he called ""Black Dog."" While this movie does not dwell on that, we do see long scenes of Churchill worried about his troops and possible war with Germany.  My favorite was his response to Halifax: ""Will you stop interrupting me while I am interrupting you!""  He really is quoted as saying this, but in this context?  It certainly makes for great cinema.  The film ends with a rousing speech to the English Parliament as Churchill walks off, Chamberlain wipes the sweat off his forehead, and Halifax states ""He mobilized the English language and sent it into battle.""Love or hate the man, Churchill has gone down in history as having saved his country from the Nazis (nevermind it was with a lot of American help).  This movie shows the dilemma Churchill faced in the late spring of 1940.  Will there be appeasement, peace, or war?  Ultimately Churchill's decision proved the right one.  I highly recommend you see this movie before watching ""Dunkirk.""","5.0 "

"Darkest Hour","""...Facing Fearful Odds..."" - Darkest Hour (A Review)","Mark Barry","It's Friday, 12 Jan 2018 in the UK and we've just come from a packed cinema - opening night for ""Darkest Hour"" - so this review covers the film with the BLU RAY details to follow when its released later in the year.First up – ""Darkest Hour"" is your first port of call for movie magic in 2018. Having said that and although it moved the audience I was with in a big way - it's far from perfect as a film - especially at the outset. But when it settles down and works - Joe Wright's latest is masterful stuff – rammed to the gunnels with a huge array of British talent and brilliance. The entire cast is magnificent - seriously stepping up to the acting plate for what you feel they instinctively know is a prestigious project.Given the press and attention lavished on it - you might also think the whole film is dominated by Gary Oldman's utterly extraordinary performance as Winston Churchill (Oscar nominated and surely his first statue in the bag – he's already taken the Golden Globe this week) – it’s not. What makes it work is a combo of three things actually. Oldman as lead of course giving his version of Churchill unbelievable humanity under all those superlative prosthetics. Second is stunning support parts from a whole array of quality actors - Ben Mendelsohn as the stuttering, smoking King George VI, Kirsten Scott-Thomas a Winnie's long-suffering but quietly supportive wife Clemmie and absolute career bests from Ronald Pickup as the beleaguered ex Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (a committed pacifist who had seen what carnage war brought to the ordinary man in World War 1) and especially Stephen Dillane as the capitulating silver-tongued Viscount Halifax (he played Stannis Baratheon in Game Of Thrones) - a performance so strong that it almost threatens to take Oldman's thunder. Add in great writing from Anthony McCarten and steady Direction from Joe Wright (""Pride & Prejudice"" and ""Atonement"") - and ""Darkest Hour"" had tears streaming down our collective cinematic kissers - and on more than one occasion. Even Lily James whose beauty always sees her getting slotted into the 'pretty girl' role - gets her best part too as Churchill's secretary and typist. During one harrowing scene – she sits stilled in pain - unable to type any further a letter that will send thousands of men to their death at Calais in order to act as a diversion for the hundreds of thousands (the entire British Army) stranded on the French coast at Dunkirk as European countries and freedoms falls like dominoes to Nazi invasion and tyranny. The staggering sacrifices made...and who had the sheer brass to make such crushing decisions...So why the four-star review and not five? There are times - especially in the first half hour - when it all seems incredibly hammy in places - and you fear that all those glowing reviews must have been carefully placed hype. And it's not really helped either by a Dario Marianelli score that often feels more 'Carry On' than 'Keep Calm'. The jokes are good but can too often grate or worse - feel forced (what a jolly old curmudgeon he was). And a very staged 'Meeting The Ordinary People On The London Underground' scene where an embattled Winston takes solace from the common folk’s stoicism and courage feels like a Richard Curtis outtake complete with the token coloured passenger. And when it comes to the all-important and rousing speeches - did Churchill actually borrow from an American Journalist (William Simms not mentioned) for his penultimate speech of never surrendering made in the House of Commons post Dunkirk. But despite this - through it all is Oldman delivering a mighty acting performance that brings mammoth-sized pathos to the man – filling him with doubts – tenderness – hurt – even childishness – behaviour the Nazis used as actual propaganda during the Blitz to come. Flaws or not – such is his investment in the part – Oldman has you glued - hanging on his every word and gesture. It’s a career best and when you take into account the dark power and honesty in his Directorial debut ""Nil By Mouth"" – long overdue credit.As ""Darkest Hour"" settles down - it becomes a stealth film - pathos and history flooring you time and time again. Winston giving the order for Operation Dynamo - the flotilla of small privately owned boats heading to Dunkirk as a nation rallies around 300,000 of its stranded troops (Dario Marianelli and his score finally delivering an emotional sweep the movie really needed). The fabulous dialogue intensity in the War Room when Winston needs to silence the wimps and the naysayers – a one-on-one with the King in a quite bedroom where the PM finally gets the support of someone that matters (a former doubter) – a conversation with President Roosevelt on the phone (a wonderfully detached David Strathairn). In fact I can’t help thinking that it would be a hard heart indeed that would remain unmoved when faced with this level of emotional onslaught.Then there’s the huge history of it – the fate of the Western World resting on such odd shoulders. His obvious big heart living in tandem with a monumental ego (many felt his initial speeches to the House of Commons were simply grandstanding by a washed-up aristocrat) – his sheer will of personality - instilling self-belief into a nation - understanding that they needed heady strength and even belligerence instead of tact and diplomacy (Spillane's character makes sense every time he speaks but also creepily lacks spine in the face of adversity). There are moments in this film when your chest heaves with the weight of what Churchill had to endure - the American Government hiding behind laws and agreements as England and its inhabitants lay moments away from destruction by true evil (and Roosevelt knew it) – a small man helpless in an even smaller broom closet with the walls slowly closing in. The cabinet bickering and jockeying for position of 'least personal blame' when a nation's very soul hung in the balance - his past military failures in Gallipoli constantly thrown in his face as evidence of his unsuitability for the job of waging war. His copious alcohol consumption, wheezing on chomped cigars, slurred speech, fits of forgetfulness and cantankerous outbursts with staff while he cheerily gives the public V-signs as if all is a bed of roses (apparently the government actively avoided public speeches because Winston came across as a sozzled mumbler). It's all here. And in the end - and perhaps even because of his faults and blemishes – a nation – our freedom - saved by an old beaten-up man with seemingly limitless inner reserves of oratory and grit. And of course as it all comes down to ‘that’ speech which Oldman delivers with beautifully controlled power and finesse - more than a few bodies in our row of seats applauded and felt their chests swell with British pride (and I’m an Irishman).Given John Lithgow's truly extraordinary and humane turn as the great man in Season 1 of ""The Crown"" (a performance he should have won awards for) - Oldman delivers even more Winston Churchill the man and the enigma - and how. Beautifully done boys - flawed in places for sure - but a triumph nonetheless.And come Tinseltown's Big Day - if Gary Oldman doesn’t win the Oscar for Male Lead in ""Darkest Hour"" then the UK Government can toss aside leaving the EU for the moment and concentrate on a land-based invasion of America. Given their present President's appalling leadership – hell they might even welcome it...","4.0 "
"Darkest Hour","Political back-stabbing","Ian Hunter","What interested me was the enduring authority Neville Chamberlain had over the Tory party; the significance of the white handkerchief. The film itself captured the period skillfully in terms of set design and costumes. Political back-stabbing was everywhere. King George VI had a bad stammer (the film The King’s Speech conveying the matter more convincingly though not conclusively – see my review). This film’s context was of course, the potential disaster and ultimate triumph of Dunkirk; in fact, little mentioned. A new dimension for me was the role of the British garrison in Calais: drawing the fire of the Germans away from Dunkirk and sacrificed; “no evacuation!” pronounced Churchill. The love between him and his wife is touching. The film comes down to the acting of Gary Oldman.

"Darkest Hour","Gary Oldman's The Whole Show","Carl Schultz","In May of 1940, after centuries of an unchallenged position of world leadership, the sun was not only setting on the British Empire—the lights were about to be turned off as well.The countries of western Europe were tumbling like dominoes before the largest army on Earth, led by an aggressive, calculating maniac driven by a philosophy of undiluted evil.  Already in political disarray, England was the solitary nation resisting the onslaught of Nazi Germany.  Either attack or invasion were imminent.  The situation couldn’t be worse.And them, thrust into the position of British leadership was a squat and ungainly little man who might’ve stepped whole and breathing from the pages of a Charles Dickens novel.Rude and abrupt, eccentric and volatile, impatient in social interaction, and with a taste for liquor and cigars, Winston Churchill was an unlikely choice for the position of hero.  Yet he ultimately inspired the people of England to hold firm through five years of some of the most punishing events in their nation’s history, and emerge triumphant over the forces of tyranny and fascism.Written by Anthony McCarten and directed by Joe Wright, “Darkest Hour” tells the story of the turbulent first month of Winston Churchill’s leadership of Great Britain during wartime.  With muted colors and occasional sepiatone, the picture itself is easy to mistake for a documentary.  That’s both a compliment and a criticism.“Darkest Hour” has lot of ground in its running time of a little over two hours.  There’s a great deal to explain, and for a viewer unfamiliar with British government much of the political maneuvering is complicated and difficult to understand.  The picture attempts to breathe life into all of it, and mostly it succeeds.But “Darkest Hour” is actor Gary Oldman’s show all the way.  His characterization of Churchill is as seamless and astonishing, and as relevant, as Daniel Day-Lewis’s performance in the title role of Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln.”  With the help of costuming and extensive latex prosthetics, the lean Oldman steps inside the portly Churchill and disappears so completely that the actor seemingly ceases to exist—it’s not Oldman onscreen so much as a living reincarnation of Britain’s wartime leader.Released last November to just four theaters in major metropolitan cities in the US, distributor Focus Features began a wider release for “Darkest Hour” on December 22, and expanded again during the first week of the new year, into 1733 theaters.And the picture is doing well with the critics:  Based on 175 reviews, Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 85%, noting that “Darkest Hour” is “held together by Gary Oldman’s electrifying performance, which brings Winston Churchill to life even when the movie’s narrative falters.”“Darkest Hour” is as challenging, intelligent, and provocative a drama as you’re likely to see, as well as a revealing study of grace under mortal pressure.  This picture is a perfect companion piece to Christopher Nolan’s worldwide hit “Dunkirk” from last year—both films cover many of the same events, from different sides of history.  And already a Golden Globe Award winner for his performance in this picture, Gary Oldman is the actor to watch during the upcoming Academy Awards competition.This little picture is a winner.  Watch for it.","4.0 "
"Darkest Hour","The man and the hour are met...","HMS Warspite","""Darkest Hour"" is a fine complement to the equally well done ""Dunkirk"", in that it provides the political what and why to the events depicted in that movie.  ""Darkest Hour"" closely follows Winston Churchill through the month of May, 1940, as he has his long-awaited political appointment with destiny.  Like ""Dunkirk"", Darkest Hour"" is ferociously authentic to the period, down to telephones and water closets and even typewriters.The best part of ""Darkest Hour"" is Gary Oldman's startlingly good performance as an aging Churchill, who has become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at a moment of deepest crisis in the Second World War.  He is well supported by Kirsten Scott Thomas as his wife Clementine and Lily James as his longsuffering typist Elizabeth Layton.  The crux of the movie is the dilemma of the British political establishment: To continue the war or seek a negotiated peace.  The movie resorts to a couple of well-executed but entirely fictional scenes to reinforce Churchill's willingness to fight on and to rally the British people, but they work well in context.The movie assumes some prior knowledge on the part of the audience of the man and the event; it is certainly geared to a knowing audience and filled with lots of delightful details for that audience.  It can be reasonably said that Churchill's decisions as shown in this movie saved the war and the West; very highly recommended.","5.0 "

"Darkest Hour","A terrific film in many respects...","FredCritic","Never mind all of this shortsighted nonsense about Darkest Hour being ""Gary Oldman's movie.""Although Oldman is magnificent, there are the supporting performances to consider as well, many of which were excellent, including:-Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI. Rivaling, in his own way, Colin Firth's performance in The King's Speech -- but with just a hint of the stuttering.-Ronald Pickup as Neville Chamberlain. I admired the way he played the character, who had been recently chopped off at the knees for capitulating to Hitler, with a humble, wounded dignity. This is the first time I've ever felt that I managed to walk in his shoes for a bit.-Kristin Scott Thomas as Clemmie, Churchill's long-suffering but loving and supportive wife. Oh, man, please don't tell me that you're one of the holdouts that still doubt Thomas's acting abilities? If this film doesn't finally convince you of her true abilities, you need to check out her work in I've Loved You For So Long, where she plays a woman who is fresh out of prison for child murdering. Watch that movie and then try to tell me she isn't a Tier I actress.In addition to the all-around superior acting performances, kudos must also go to the makeup artists (you can barely recognize Oldman --- he claims that it took several hours each morning for the makeup people to do his face), the set designer (as far as I'm concerned, that actually was the House of Commons and the King's Palace and the London underground), and the cinematographer (thank you for the persistent reminders, shown by way of light and shadow, that this was indeed England's darkest hour). And not to forget to mention the script -- unlike other Churchill biopics, this one gets inside of the man much more deeply and effectively than any of the other depictions I've seen, showing him warts and all like he's never been shown before. This is definitely not a hagiography. And what about all of the hell he went through? Forget about the members of his own party turning against Churchill -- you'll witness Churchill transforming into his own worst enemy at many points in this movie, demonstrating that it wasn't only England's darkest hour, there was also the darkest hour going on inside the man.But getting back to Oldman's performance -- as far as I'm concerned, he wipes the floor with the Churchill portrayals of Brian Cox and Albert Finney and Richard Burton and some of the other actors I've seen who struggled to put the old man across realistically.","5.0 "

He went on the underground once but his wife stated that he had no idea where to get off. That's it. The movie had him asking all manner of questions trying to get support for standing up for England. He did in fact stand up for England but in the press as he was a excellent writer.Gary Oldman won an award for his performance in the Darkest Hour. This is my opinion only and I am not downgrading Gary Oldman's performance in any way. He played the part as he was given and did it well.  Kathryn D.","2.0 "

Having seen other biopics on Churchill, like Gathering Storm, I guess I was spoiled. Also, I'm old enough to remember when Churchill was still alive, and I've listened to virtually all of his recorded speeches. Oldham's depiction is not very accurate, and this is a clear case of art being in the eye of the beholder. There's also a musical disconnect in this movie -- it starts out rather lyrical, as if setting up a comedy. For me, the only bright spot in this movie was Kristin Scott Thomas' portrayal of Clementine Churchill. Much more at ease with John Lithgow's representation in Season 1 of The Crown.","3.0 "
"Darkest Hour","Dominions","Brian Morgan","""Darkest Hour"" is a terrifically-exciting film, and is directed by Joe Wright, who directed the incomparable ""Anna Karenina"" (2012).  The argument revolves around the early days of Sir Winston Churchill's tenure as Prime Minister of Great Britain, during World War II.  The picture does not delve into the complex reasons for the War, and, despite its dramatic tautness, it will be remembered chiefly as an actors' vehicle.  So be it.The film stars Gary Oldman, Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, Lily James, Stephen Dillane, and Ben Mendelsohn.  Oldman is uncanny as Sir Winston, full of fire and theatricality.  It is difficult to imagine that this is the same actor who gave us such memorable portrayals of Lee Harvey Oswald, Count Dracula, and Pontius Pilate!  Yet his is not the only remarkable performance:  Dame Kristin, still a beautiful woman, captures Lady Churchill in a most engaging manner.  Another towering portrayal is given by Mendelsohn, as King George VI, who is able to suggest great depths and layers in his characterization.Additionally, Ronald Pickup is brilliant as Neville Chamberlain.  At first, this writer did not even recognize the actor, so well does he capture the image of the ill-fated statesman.  This is the latest in a remarkable gallery of cinematic portrayals from an underrated artist that includes such diverse personages as Igor Strawinsky, Giuseppe Verdi, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Giulio Ricordi.The film is an exciting adventure, reminding us how powerful is the cinema's potential.","5.0 "
"Darkest Hour","Not the authentic Churchill","Roger J. Buffington","I guess I am the one who has to say it: I did not like Gary Oldman's performance as Winston Churchill.  He combined a slapstick perspective with a sad attempt at humor, and made Churchill into a doddering drunk.  Yes, Churchill famously liked whiskey and said ""I have taken more out of whiskey than it has ever taken out of me.""  Nonetheless the ""Darkest Hour"" period shortly before the fall of Chamberlain and the evacuation at Dunkirk was a grim, serious, fateful period of time where there was little time for humor.  This film completely misses that, as does Oldman's performance.  I have seen many better actor portrayals of Churchill -- this one misses the mark.The subway scene, where Churchill mingles with the common people and takes the measure of their determination, is nicely done, but again misses the essential Churchill.  Churchill was a determined and implacable foe of the Nazis or surrender or accommodation with Hitler long before he became Prime Minister.  He did not need the reassurance of the people on this point and probably did not care much what public opinion was on this subject -- he thought that the facts spoke for themselves and he was determined upon a war policy of ""blood, toil, tears, and sweat"" regardless of what the accommodationists thought.  Churchill intended to lead public opinion, not cater to it.I am just old enough to remember the real Churchill, who was often in the news or on television during the 50s and 60s.  This film misses him. Oldman is not him.  RJB.","3.0 "
"Darkest Hour","History always surpasses fiction in drama…","Dimitrios","The film begins in the spring of 1940 when Britain is already at war with Germany. Current Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, has lost the confidence of Parliament and the King is forced to allow Churchill to take over the war effort, just the day that the Germans launch their hugely successful attack in the West on May 10th, 1940. With the weight of the country on his shoulders, Churchill must battle not just Nazism, but his own parliament and he succeeds in a terrific way, with the masterly use of language as his most valuable weapon. The film is astonishing. It shows the cabinet bickering and jockeying for position of “least personal blame” when a nation's very soul hung in the balance - Churchill's past military failures in Gallipoli constantly thrown in his face as evidence of his unsuitability for the job of waging war - his copious alcohol consumption, wheezing on chomped cigars, slurred speech, fits of forgetfulness and cantankerous outbursts with staff while he cheerily gives the public V-signs as if all is a bed of roses. Gary Oldman, in an Oscar worthy performance as Churchill (in which he absolutely deserves the golden statue), he utterly transformed himself. The only thing that irked me about the whole film was one scene near the end which felt totally unbelievable and scripted. Churchill supposedly uses the London tube for the first time but in fact it was a moment of total fiction but it worked fine to complete the picture of the “Darkest Hour” in the most sentimental way. There is also a big discrepancy about the Siege of Calais. The film does Churchill a disservice by giving the impression that Brigadier Claude Nicholson’s 30th Infantry Brigade were sacrificed by Churchill in order to save the 300,000 odd soldiers on the beach at Dunkirk; whereas in fact the overwhelming majority of Claude Nicholson’s men were taken prisoner, Nicholson included. Simply just watch this film for Oldman's acting alone, you won't regret it. The supporting cast were also decent, and Ben Mendelsohn was in my opinion far more convincing as King George VI than Colin Firth in “King’s Speech”. The film is a couple of hours long, but it certainly sped past for me. Excellent film, true (in most part) to historical authenticity…","5.0 "
"Darkest Hour","Further Proof of Gary Oldman's Greatness","Rockin' Rik","Let's face it the reason this film is good is Gary Oldman. Quite arguably the greatest living actor outsode of Daniel Day-Lewis because of his uncanny ability to become people and have many going oh that's Gary? Finally after many years of being wasted on whatever junk he was given outside of Tinker Tailor and the small but effective part of James Gordon in The Dark Knight Trilogy he gets to truly act again as only he can. Many go on and on about the speeches since Oldman is playing Churchill and my god are they great but also the little subtleties, voice and mannerisms we get a truly great performance. While not a great film, things are truly lifted higher by Oldman's performance. Actors Ben Mendelsohn and Stephen Dillane are highly effective as well but Oldman knocks it out of the park. He deserves all the acclaim and attention he is getting and highly deserves the Oscar despite the smear campaign going on by certain parties. Regardless, we have a true character study of Churchill the man, what made him tick, and how we went about things.","4.0 "
"Darkest Hour","LIVING UP TO THE LEGEND","Mark Turner","For those of us who grew up in the 60s and 70s we grew up with the iconic personas of the past, historical figures that transformed history we were reading about WWII into reality as we knew it. While many of those figures had passed away a few remained. One of those was Winston Churchill. We’d read or listened to recordings of his speeches. Movies have been made about his life but few have the impact or provide as in depth a depiction of the man as DARKEST HOUR.The film opens with Parliament in turmoil. The year is 1940 and the predictions Churchill made about Hitler and Nazi Germany have come to fruition. Belgium and France have both been invaded. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain’s (Ronald Pickup) hope for peace has been crushed and his removal from office demanded. But who to put in his place? The position is offered to Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane) but he turns it down. To placate both sides of Parliament they choose Churchill (Gary Oldman).Our first glimpse of Churchill comes as he awakened at home to interview a new girl as his personal secretary. Elizabeth Layton (Lilly James) is nervous and warned about numerous personal idiosyncrasies that Churchill has. It doesn’t take long before those pour forth as he chastises, yells and insults her causing her to run from the room. Before leaving she is handed a telegraph to deliver to him, the word that he has been offered the post of Prime Minister.Churchill forms his cabinet and in an effort to please both parties selects both Chamberlain and Halifax to be a part of it. He then moves forward with his own view of what to do with the current invasion of all European states by Hitler: fight on to the bitter end. Of course this doesn’t sit well with Chamberlain, Halifax and their party who instead push the idea of peace.As the movie progresses we’re presented with three stories running concurrently. The first is the political maneuverings among party lines. While Halifax may have turned down the opportunity to become PM it doesn’t mean he isn’t ambitious. By allowing Churchill to take the position he has room to move and perhaps form a contingency to remove Churchill from office and take his place, sowing seeds of discontent among his peers behind the scenes.The second is the imminent battles being fought in France. Churchill continues to believe in the strength of the combined forces of the British and French armies. As those begin to crumble and the soldiers retreat he must then make the decision to find a way to rescue them or to capitulate to Hitler. The last location the troops can make is the seaside town of Dunkirk.The third story here revolves around Churchill’s personal life. Scenes with his wife Clemmie (Kristin Scott Thomas), his family and those friends closest to him, few though there may be. His brash and bullying attitude has earned him no long list of allies. Even King George VI (Ben Mendelson) is wary of his being in this position. How Churchill can overcome his overbearing ways and save the country makes for one tremendously dramatic story.The movie does a tremendous job of bringing both the man and history to life. Instead of boring newsreel footage that we’ve seen again and again we’re made privy to what went on in the back rooms and secluded war rooms of the British Empire. Knowing what we now know of the things Hitler and the Nazis did it seems inconceivable that the British military would even consider a peace agreement with them but they did. And the speech that Churchill presents near the very end of the film remains as stirring today as it was when it was delivered.The entire movie relies on one major thing and that is the performance of Oldman as Churchill. Many actors have played this role. And with the right prosthetic makeup many would be able to look like the man. But it takes an enormous amount of skill to not just look like Churchill but to bring him to life. Oldman has done that here in the most amazing way. Every nuance in his abilities is used here to make the man come alive. Moments occur where the words are gone and he falls silent but the emotions, concerns and mindset of the man are on display by Oldman. He won the Oscar for Best Male Performance and deservedly so for his role here.Earlier this year we were presented with the film DUNKIRK about what happened on those beaches that day. This movie would make a fantastic double feature with that film, using this one to set up what happened that day and the month prior. That’s all this movie focuses on, the month that it took for Churchill to take office, pull off Dunkirk and to inspire a nation. It does so looking glorious at the same time with cinematography, set design, costuming and makeup that make you feel as if you are there. You can’t pay a better compliment to a film than that.","5.0 "

I really wanted to like this movie and to enjoy Gary Oldman's Oscar winning performance.  But I didn't.  One problem was the sound.  There were places where the dialog was completely overridden by the background noise and you couldn't understand what the speakers were saying.  This happened a lot.  Oldman's performance, in my opinion, was good, but not up to the level of hype that has surrounded it.  I found the film disjointed, maybe that was deliberate, an attempt to convey the confusion of the time and the uncertainty of the new Prime Minister, but I just found it distracting.  The film also doesn't give anyone without at least basic knowledge about WWII anything much to go on to fill out the terse and jumpy plot.  I would image some viewers were quite confused.  I found the domestic vignettes largely meaningless and wished they had been sacrificed to the main story line.  One scene in the movie that I did find very moving and impactful [the only such scene] is Churchill's ride on the underground to get the views of the average Brit in the street [so to speak].  That scene had a resonance the rest of the film lacked entirely.  This isn't a bad film, for me, it just doesn't live up to its reputation.","3.0 "

In spite of being British and having been bombarded with information about WW2 (at school and from my family who lived through it) I loved the flow of the movie and still learned a couple of new things, i.e the conversation Churchill has with Roosevelt (thanks for nothing mate) and the sacrificed garrison at Calais is incredibly heart breaking. People have questioned the scene where Churchill traveled the underground - no he did not do this but I see the relevance of the scene as it was a way of showing the British peoples mood at the time and what they wanted as opposed to the politicians. The movie itself did cause me to question a few things about the war but as my mother (who lived through it) pointed out to me, ""Churchill was the prime minister we NEEDED at the time"".

"Darkest Hour","The banality of greatness","Edward G.","The Darkest Hour tells the tale of the first five weeks of Winston Churchill's first stint as prime minister of England in the spring of 1940. It was a tumultuous time. Adolf Hitler's troops were racing through Europe and that led to the ouster of Neville ""peace for our time"" Chamberlain as prime minister.As the search for Chamberlain's successor progressed Lord Halifax was the favorite of most of the Conservative Party, and of King George, but Halifax could not get enough support from Clement Atlee and his Labour Party. Winston Churchill, who had fought against appeasement for four years, had broad support and won the office.(Though some say that Halifax did not want the job -- in fact, he says that in this film -- that does not appear to be the reason he did not get it. Nor does the fact that he was a lord in the House of Lords rather than a member of the House of Commons.)That's the history, and the movie follows that history faithfully while taking liberties with the day-to-day activities portrayed in the film. And even though the filmmakers added some fictional elements to the history to make it more lively, what struck me most about the film was how real-life greatness is banal. Not bad banal, but pedestrian, prosaic, ordinary banal.What do I mean by that? Simply that Winston Churchill, King George, and the other major figures involved seemed like ordinary people with ordinary motivations. The film showed Winston Churchill coming naked out of his bath, stepping into a ""water closet"", feeding tidbits of food to a dog while eating with the king, and bickering with his wife about bills. The film showed King George piqued and not wanting to make Winston Churchill prime minister because Churchill supported King George's brother King Edward abdicating the throne to marry divorcee Wallis Simpson.The film was not deep or profound or depressing. Indeed, even though a war movie it sort of dazzled as a period piece with both set and actors recreating history. Sort of like Downton Abbey (the actress Lily James was in both this film and that production, which helped connect the two for me). The film was moving at times, but it never really felt real. More like a soap opera or tear jerker than true-life drama.All in all, though, I liked the film. More than horror it focused on heroics. And more than deeds it focused on words. Winston Churchill was quite the ""word-spinner"", winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1953 for his speeches as well as his writing. Although he said, quite rightly, that ""words are easy and many, while great deeds are difficult and rare"", he was the rare man who excelled at both.","5.0 "

"Darkest Hour","I liked the history, but there was no need to make Churchill look like a buffoon.","No BS guy","As a history buff, I really looked forward to this film.  I was disappointed.  While it did demonstrate the almost unsurmountable problems Churchill was faced with when he became prime minister, I was truly disappointed is the buffoonish way Churchill was portrayed during most of the movie.  He was a bit eccentric, but if he was as big a goofball as he was portrayed in the movie, he would never have succeeded.  I guess Hollywood must always portray conservatives in a demeaning fashion, even when they are saving the free world.  I had wondered how Hollywood gave the academy award to a man portraying a conservative politician, and now I know.On the good part, the movie does mention a few items of significance too often overlooked.  1. The ambition of Lord Halifax and what he was willing to do to achieve power.  2. The fact that Neville Chamberlain was dying of cancer(pancreatic as it turned out).  He died about 6 months after stepping down.  However, historians and the movie as well ignore the fact that his many blunders when dealing with Hitler may well have been partly due to his deteriorating physical condition and lack of stamina as a result thereof(Although pancreatic cancer is usually fatal in a matter of months after diagnosis, this is because the symptoms are often nonspecific and the tumor is large and metastatic at time of diagnosis.  However, the tumor mass grows over a period of years prior to diagnosis and does have deleterious effects on the patient during this time.).  3. The fact that Churchill was willing to make the difficult decisions-ordering a suicidal attack by 4000 troops in Calais in order to distract the Germans and save the 300,000 troops from Dunkirk-needed to win the war.  This necessity for Britain's survival was wrongly viewed as a bloody disregard for the lives of his citizens  and resulted in his being voted out of office by the very people he saved from the Nazis within months of the end of the war.Thus, though I liked certain aspects of the movie, I was disappointed that it was not true to one of the greatest men of the 20th century.","3.0 "

The members of the British parliament think that Chamberlain is a loser and nobody but Churchill wants the job.Hitler is just overrunning Europe and everything seems lost. The entire British army and Navy is stranded at Dunkirk, France, across the English Channel.Equally worried is King George VI. played by Ben Mendelsohn. Chamberlain and the member of parliament wants him to flee to Canada but King George knows that if he does, he won't return and lose everything. Even though he does not like Churchill, the King offers his friendship when he realizes that he and Churchill are sitting in the same boat.One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is when King George visits Churchill unexpectedly and unannounced. Churchill in his morning robe and King George dressed like a King dresses have a personal talk and align their goals.Unfortunately, the movie isn't all perfect. The beautiful and powerful personal moments are interrupted by scenes of screaming MPs filmed from above, idiotic shots of German planes bombing France in a regular, symmetrical  pattern, an artificially looking armada of ships evacuating the British troops (Operation Dynamo), and finally at the end of the movie British MPs who raise their arms while doing a wave like spectators in a football stadium after Churchill's speech.

As he maneuvers his political rivals, he must confront the ultimate choice — negotiate with Hitler and save the British people at a monumental cost or rally the nation and fight on against overwhelming odds.Oldman is exceptional as Churchill, with heavy make-up and body padding helping to transform the actor into the enigmatic man plagued with doubts about his decisions, yet a powerful inspiration in a nation under attack. Oldman replicates Churchill’s theatrical, dramatic speech pattern which allowed him to reach the British populace over the radio. He also has mastered body movements and mannerisms, resulting in a truly extraordinary performance. We see a man who, despite his fondness for cigars and alcohol, was capable of good judgment and clear focus in times of crisis.The film focuses on a period when Churchill had not yet proven himself to the British people or to himself. Wife Clementine (Kristin Scott Thomas) is on hand to encourage and serve as a buffer between harsh public opinion and a man who is more sensitive and unsure of himself than his public image suggests. This is a portrait of Churchill the movies have not previously shown. Usually, he is depicted as the steadfast bulldog, defiant and determined to stand up to Hitler’s juggernaut. The screenplay by Anthony McCarten portrays Churchill as a flawed, yet driven man rather than larger-than-life savior of the British Isles. He’s humanized, and we witness how he had to deal not just with the Germans but with attacks from within the country.Bonus materials on the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include feature commentary with director Joe Wright, and the featurettes “Into Darkest Hour” and “Gary Oldman: Becoming Churchill.” A digital copy is enclosed.","4.0 "
"Darkest Hour","A Powerful Performance by Oldman, Given the Stage to Itself","drqshadow","Against the backdrop of the second world war, with mainland Britain on the brink of a Nazi invasion, Winston Churchill is appointed prime minister amidst almost universal reluctance. Determinedly anti-capitulation, he's swimming against the stream from day one with an embarrassed, vengeful political faction in his war ministry and a wary, unconvinced king watching his every move. The entire weight of this film rests on the strength of its central performance, as one might argue any biopic should, and Gary Oldman, once again, proves up to the task. His take on Churchill is transformative and enveloping. He lives the role, becoming this historical giant through wardrobe and makeup, but also speech, posture and subtle mannerism. The power of his convictions on full display, we can almost see each sharp, momentous proclamation form upon his quivering lips before it's barked out into the air. In fact, that formulation is a crucial piece of the story: as his speeches and opinions develop, we see them change shape, wording and direction, progressing through various rough drafts to a tight, powerful, focused final product. The plot tends to slow down at points, and not every supporting character deserves the scrutiny they receive, but as mere decoration for the one man show, those flaws can be somewhat overlooked. Overall, it's a very well-constructed, finely focused narrative that gives the audience a sweeping glimpse of the man himself, both guarded before the sting of his political enemies and vulnerable in the friendlier confines of his home or office. Interesting to pair this with Dunkirk, a fellow Best Picture nominee, as the two explore the same military event from very different perspectives.","4.0 "
"Darkest Hour","Was peace even an option?","Paul Durgala","This film chronicles one of the earliest and most suspenseful periods of World War 2.  In the Spring of 1940 Hitler had invaded Poland and in response, as promised, France and Britain declared war on Germany.  The German war machine, however,  proved swifter and more formidable than they had anticipated and by May the situation had become desperate.  The French army had been all but crushed and the British Expeditionary Force (some 300,000 men) was stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk and about to be wiped out by the advancing German army.  In response to this looming disaster Parliament and King George appointed the one man who could turn the situation around......Winston Churchill.Every good story needs ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" and this film definitely seems to paint Chamberlain and Lord Halifax as the ""bad guys"".  They were the ones who (according to the film) were undermining Churchill at every turn and were willing to practically give up their country to the Germans, if somehow they could preserve the peace.  I'm not sure that this is a fair representation.  It's important to remember that both Chamberlain and Halifax had lived through the First World War.  They had witnessed the brutal butchery of modern mechanized warfare.  Nine million men were killed or severely injured during that war.  It was costly both monetarily and in human life.  They shared an attitude that was quite common at the time, that such a disaster must not be repeated.  It was felt (not without some merit) that the next war would be the war that would wipe out all civilization. They were desperate not to let that happen.Against this backdrop stood Winston Churchill.  Churchill was different from most other statesmen in that he had actually read Mein Kampf.  He understood Hitler better than most, and he realized there could be no peace with Hitler in the long run.  He realized early on that Hitler's plan for taking over Eastern Europe, enslaving the slavic peoples, eliminating the jews, and instituting brutal authoritarian rule was a program that no rational and moral people could tolerate.  He also realized that Hitler would honor his agreements only so long as it suited him and then dispense with them when it was convenient to do so.  Hence the admission that Chamberlain made in the film where he said ""He was right about Hitler.""I do have one quibble with the film.  It seems to present Churchill as a middle-aged man in constant need of nurturing and coddling, as if he couldn't even get out of bed in the morning without his wife's help.  I don't think that's an accurate portrayal.  I'm pretty sure that he was more formidable than that.  He would've had to have been, to have led Britain through that dreadful period.I know that some have questioned the historical accuracy of Churchill's doubts over whether or not to negotiate some kind of peace with Hitler.  The historical record clearly shows, however, that he did, at least at one point consider some kind of a peace deal.  Eventually he abandoned that notion and committed himself, and the nation to total war.Some have complained about the obviously fictitious portrayal of Churchill riding the subway (""underground"") to talk to the common people and get a sense of what they thought the country should do.  The historical record clearly shows, however,  that Churchill was known to take unexpected excursions where he would be seen talking to people in parks and in cafes and in other places.  The reason for these excursions, other than taking a badly needed break, was to mix with the common people and to try to get a sense of what they thought and felt.  In that regard, I'd have to say Churchill was a brilliant politician.In summary, I'd say that Darkest Hour is an excellent portrayal of a great man and a great leader during one of the most dire periods in world history and, apart from the one quibble that I mentioned above, I would recommend it to any adult and any young person eleven years old  or older..  Elementary age children might find the pacing of the film rather heavy and grim.","4.0 "
"Darkest Hour","Overrated and Disappointing","Eric","I really wanted to like this movie and had been waiting anxiously for its release to watch it. I would consider myself a strong student of history and World War II in particular. But left entirely unimpressed and cannot recommend the movie. Much seems to be made of Gary Oldman’s portrayal of Churchill, but it really was simply poor. He came across as a bumbling idiot (yes, I know Winston had his issues but this takes it too far) rather than anyone who had any business being in command of an extremely precarious situation and country leading into one of modern history’s most important conflicts. Even minor details like his conversation via telephone with FDR seem “fake” and out of place. I keep waiting for the eventual “rally the crowd” speech, which finally came at the end, but was equally unimpressive. Don’t bother spending money on this entirely mediocre movie. LOTS of better options.","2.0 "

But I was surprised how Churchill was portrayed. He is depicted as a doddering, bumbling, mumbling old fool - not as the staunch defender of Britain. I simply don't know if he really was that way, or whether this is a revisionist portrayal. Either way, I found the film unrewarding.","1.0 "
"Darkest Hour","Good portrayal by Oldman","JWINK","The Darkest Hour depicts a small period of time early in turmoil of WWII and Churchill’s appointment as Prime Minister.  I have always been fascinated by the various moments and individuals involved in this period of history and this movie along with the recent Dunkirk provides some interesting glimpses of WWII history.Gary Oldman provides a brilliant performance as Churchill (along with a great makeup job) and it is his performance that really carries the movie through.  Although there are some moments of historical accuracy, the movie accurately captures the demeanor of Churchill and the dark moments of the time involved.Instead of grand action sequences, this movie tends to focus more on the drama and politics surrounding Churchill at the time.  The subway scene felt a bit out of place in the movie, but I do get the point of the scene.I won’t say the story is as strongly written as other films depicting the period as it sticks to a rather simple approach of broadly depicting that period around Dunkirk but I still found the movie to be entertaining to watch.4 stars","4.0 "

"Darkest Hour","Where's the Backbone and What did He Say?","mk","I'm glad Gary Oldman won the Oscar, for what it's worth.  The movie I anxiously anticipated was a bit of a let down- at least for me.I like the actors (especially Gary Oldman), the filming and the quality of the filmmaking- in general.  I've really enjoyed Joe Wright directing abilities as seen in Pride and Prejudice.  His long, extended scenes are amazing, and his movies always feature top notch people and production values.  We used to call them 'A' movies.Here's the 'but', I found this movie boring at times; definitely, not moving.  Churchill is portrayed as a stammering, hard to understand, almost doddering, old man.  I believe he was 65 at the time?  One waits for the whole film to get his stirring speech, and it was less than inspiring.I had to keep repeating, ""What did he say""- throughout the movie.Well made flick, lacking umph, tries to build tension(it does to some degree); wouldn't watch again.","3.0 "
"Darkest Hour","Excellent movie, excellent acing, but Churchill is sold short","Tom Holzel","Watching this very well-made movie while reading Thomas E. Ricks’ book “Churchill & Orwell” was an eye-opener. In both cases, Churchill is portrayed as an outsider, disliked by both conservative and liberal parties (which he switched between), and yet still able to reach the top of government. At the top he is met with entrenched resistance at every turn. Most of his fight for political survival consists of both fighting the ruling upper class, and getting them to do their jobs.  The parallel between Churchill’s entry into national politics and that of President Trump could not be closer. Both men had to first “drain the swamp” in order to finally rule.While the movie was exceptionally well made, it began to bother me the next day at how insidious a piece of anti-Churchill propaganda the narrative really is.While Churchill is given a few rousing speeches to rally the public—and the movie viewer—most of his portrayal consists of him continuously drinking to excess, and blubbering out often ridiculous  seat-of-the pants directives to an incredulous High Command. In the background the leaders of his party actively plot to remove him from office. Wow, does that sound familiar!The entire movie circles around the incredible situation of Dunkirk—the encirclement of the entire British Army by the advancing German Army. We are firmly told that the Royal Navy is helpless against the might of the German Air Force. There is no hope, we are told again and again, at doing anything about their plight except—his party leaders demand—negotiations with Hitler via Mussolini. “You cannot negotiate with a tiger when he has your head in its mouth!” Churchill bellowed.  This demand to negotiate is made by very reasonable characters. It is hard not to agree with the logic of their position, but, of course, Churchill, as the bellicose war monger, cannot do so because a few passengers he met on his first ride on the underground demanded he never surrender.Instead, in a moment of complete desperation, Churchill has the Navy send every civilian boat between 30 to 100 ft. across the channel to rescue the entire 300,000 soldiers, which the Luftwaffe does nothing to impede. .Churchill emerges as the hero of Britain, having, somehow, completely outfoxed formerly omnipotent  Führer.The elephant in this room is this: Why, if the German Luftwaffe prevented the Royal Navy from rescuing its men of the beaches of Normandy, could a few hundred civilian vessels succeed? The answer is one of WW-II’s most enduring mysteries. Hitler held off his Armies from annihilating the British for reasons no one has been able to discern then and now. Thus, Churchill’s civilian rescue gamble succeeded due only to a completely unforeseeable miracle. His entire High Command was right—the war was lost; the only question was, would it be lost by surrender and survival or by surrender after the annihilation of the entire British Army. Instead a true miracle occurred and Churchill got all the glory.Thus, Churchill’s real “victory”—if being completely pushed out of Europe can so be called—did only one thing—buy time for the Americans to finally enter the war and once again pull the British chestnuts out of the fire.These sour grapes should not take too much away from this otherwise very fine movie. The acting was superb all around (the role of Churchill is surely Oscar- worthy) and the somewhat overwrought photography—how  many vertical pull-backs is too many?—did enhance the stark drama of the incredible situation Churchill found himself in. Go see it. It is a very well-made, very tense drama with many endearing vignettes. The two hours went by in a flash.","5.0 "
"Darkest Hour","Wright gets it right, Oldman is perfection.","A Brogden","It's a pity. It's a pity Joe Wright didn't direct ""Dunkirk"". While it's true as others have pointed out the movie isn't moment by moment accurate; it get's the overall arc events and mood almost perfectly. If anything it let's the odious Lord Halifax off too lightly. Eventually, Churchill, tiring of his constant machinations and double-dealing would banish him to Washington as Ambassador.... And then completely cut him out of all but ceremonial functions by dealing directly with Roosevelt. Ironically Roosevelt was forced to recall his Ambassador, Joseph P Kennedy (JFK's father) for his pro-German stance and pessimistic assessments of Britain's chances. For roughly three weeks the fate of Western Europe hung in the balance, Churchill's character and indomitable will tipped the scales. For one full year Britain would fight alone until the following summer, Hitler invaded Russia. Six months later, after Pearl Harbor he inexplicably declared war on America. Churchill's purported response upon receiving the news....""Thank God, now we cannot lose""...","5.0 "
"Darkest Hour","Great Acting and Cinematography- Historical Joke","JB","Wonderfull acting and cinematography. It certainly captures the spirit of the age.While I realize movies have to take historical licence to tell complex events. For example, composite characters and explanatory dialog to explain settings.Unfortunately the writers have created a historic farce. And why? The story, well documented and not open to serious debate, is as dramatic as one could possibly be.The Churchill, Halifax, Chamberlain relationship portrayed as a conspiracy never happened. The possibility of a negotiated settlement with Germany, possibly the single most important event in history, is extreme revisionist and doesn't hold up to any serious scholarship. Churchill did not waver and did not ride in the tube to find his resolve among Londoners. So much dramatic licence even to the dates. The overwrought use of the changing date shots gets the events wrong to make the timeline fit a fantasy narrative.The brief FDR/Churchill dialog does a good job at capturing how weak Roosevelt was and how his inability to lead very nearly resulted in the collapse of Democracy.And no there is simply no comparisons to make between Churchill and the latest demagogue delivered up by history. Hopefully a Churchillian character is amongst us now and he/she will deliver him to the dustbin of history as Winston succeeded in doing.If one wishes to learn about leadership and a great man under the pressure of unforeseen events where the outcome was unknowable see:Martin Gilbert, ChurchillJohn Lukacs, Five Days in MayAndrew Roberts, Masters and Commanders","2.0 "
"Darkest Hour","Great subject; hackneyed treatment","Robert Blenheim","Joe Wright’s “Darkest Hour” poses a problem for me.  The subject is interesting and important, but the film, following Winston Churchill’s early days as Prime Minister of Britain during World War II, never rises above the average.  Worse: one could also say that -- in the fictitious sequence, about 2/3rds of the way through, when Churchill rides the tube to talk person-to-person with average British citizens riding the train -- it comes to life precisely at the same moment it sinks into cliché, and credulity is strained past the breaking point.  Ultimately, Oldman playing Churchill is the only thing that makes this movie experience worthwhile.  (But Joe Wright has seen better days -- especially in his 2007 masterpiece, “Atonement”, the extraordinary film that incidentally introduced 12-year-old Saoirse Ronan to the world.) Not much better than a BBC-TV movie of the week.","3.0 "

The screenplay is riddled with cliches reminiscent of Hollywood circa 1940. Absurd to think that Churchill would have changed his mind about conducting the war after chatting with adoring Londoners on a subway train. I assume the cozy meeting between Winston and King George is also largely a fabrication.Viscount Halifax is given the role of the ""bad guy."" Although it's true that Halifax wanted to explore peace talks in May, 1940 (was that necessarily a cowardly thing to consider?) he was far from being a craven appeaser of Hitler and went on to serve as Britain's ambassador to the U.S. during the war. No mention of Halifax's relatively successful tenure as Viceroy of India, or even of the fact that he was born without a left hand.As for Oldman's take on Churchill,  I don't think it's as good as Albert Finney's and certainly pales with comparison with Robert Hardy's. Oldman portrays Winston as an old man, subject to mumbling and petulance, But by most eyewitness accounts Winston at 65 ""looked twenty years younger"" once he became Prime Minister. In documentary footage I've watched he seems extraordinarily vigorous and alert, most memorably in footage of his secret meeting with FDR aboard HMS Prince of Wales in 1941.The swelling orchestral score was relentless.","2.0 "
"Darkest Hour","‘You can not reason with a Tiger when your head is in its mouth.’","Grady Harp","History wrote this story but Anthony McCarten translated it into a screenplay for Joe Wright to direct one of the truly great films of the year. The film is about the month of May in 1940, the odd rise to power of Winston Churchill, and the near miraculous survival of the island of England because of the rascal/devil obstinacy of Churchill’s commitment not to give in to Hitler’s sweep of the world into a globe of fascism. And crowning the importance of this film is the impeccable performance of Gary Oldman in the role of Churchill.‘Hitler has invaded Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, and Norway. 3 million German troops are now poised on the Belgian border, ready to conquer the rest of Europe. In Britain, Parliament has lost faith in its leader Neville Chamberlain. The search for a replacement has already begun...’  So opens the film. With Europe on the threshold of World War II as Hitler's armies rampage across the continent's once proud nations, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup), is forced to resign, appointing Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) as his replacement. But even in his early days as the country's leader, Churchill is under pressure to commence peace negotiations with the German dictator or to fight head-on the seemingly invincible Nazi regime, whatever the cost. However difficult and dangerous his decision may be, Winston Churchill has no choice, but to shine in his darkest hour. He gains the favor of King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn), the assistance from his secretary (Lily James) and wife (Kirsten Scott Thomas), and the tolerance of peacenik Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane). Of course the ending is known: Churchill overcame the darkest hour and saved England by refusing to stand down.This is one of the most successful historical films to date and it is so very appropriate that it was released in the same year as DUNKIRK – the battle that involved the people and polished the British tenacity.

Ours has become the cinematic age of Disney’s revisionary Star Wars, Marvel’s cheerful Avengers, and DC’s sulky Batman and Superman. Moreover there appears to be no end in sight as the entertainment industry solidifies a process that has grown to encapsulate both kids and adults. Watch a superficial film, buy the accompanying toys, visit the ride at the parks. Rinse and repeat ad nauseam.  But there are still exceptions at times. There are on occasion meat-and-vegetables types of films if you look for them. These are films that bring actual history to the screen. They are not just films for entertainment but also education as well. These films have something important and clear to teach us about our actual world and how it came to be. And most importantly they seek to depict the real blood, sweat, and tears poured out to bring us the world we inherit today.  Darkest Hour is precisely this type of film.  The two-hour documentary-style work provides a laser-precise focus into the mind and inner struggles of Winston Churchill during World War II. The film begins with Churchill’s acceptance of the prime minister position and illustrates his struggle to unit the British government against Nazi Germany. We learn that the outcome of British resolve was by no means a forgone conclusion as formidable political elements pushed Churchill to pursue a path of appeasement instead of armed resistance.  Today’s critics will no doubt deride the film as slow or even dull. Whereas the average viewer might expect dueling portrayals of posturing between Churchill and Hitler amidst cataclysmic violence, the film takes a decidedly different turn. The camera purposefully gives us very little Hitler in exchange for almost exclusive access to the United Kingdom. Darkest Hour shows us the sum of British inter-politics and the polarized fights of party leaders over what to do with their fear. Churchill’s role in this context is to galvanize the assembly into defiant action against an all-but-certain threat.  If you’ve partaken of a good chunk of the recent superhero or space films over the past few years (as I have), then you will likely find yourself wholly unprepared for this film. I found myself struggling to have any sympathy for Churchill’s opponents. Modern cinema has taught us that Nazis are evil because they are evil, right? Evil must be opposed because that’s why it exists. Villains are supposed to put up a good fight and pull a few unexpected tricks, but in the end we know it’s their role to die in utter defeat. Appeasement or cowering to them doesn’t make for a good show.  Darkest Hour snaps us out of this trance as we realize that real-life opposition to evil is never that simple. Before Churchill can even get to the Nazis, he must first battle the darkness within himself. At his wife’s supportive insistence Churchill wrestles repeatedly with his own brashness, rudeness, and disregard for the common person. He fluctuates back and forth with his desire to be accommodating to his political opponents while also pushing them in the direction he knows best. And near the end of the film he confronts his own vulnerabilities and sense of defeat, searching and finding support in places he never expected.  This is a story of how leadership and true heroism are fashioned. It is not a glamorous, attractive, individualistic, or even fun process. It is a constant and communal war to tame ugly sin within oneself and help others diminish their faults. It is a relentless desire to work within, through, and around processes one may not like. Churchill does all this -- at times well and at other times not so well. His rise is one of conflicted evolution as various members alternatively bring out the best and worst in him. He learns, however violently, that he must listen to and respect others in order to empower them. The whole depiction is nuanced, believable, and morally captivating.  This isn’t to say that Darkest Hour is a perfect film. Much of the historical context of the film is implied or even assumed. Those with thorough knowledge of the circumstances and unfolding of World War II may be delighted, but the rest of us may find ourselves uncertain as to the exact effect of Churchill’s actions. No bombing raids of Britain ever appear on screen to justify Churchill’s mobilization of his comrades. And the ending certainly needed more work to bring Churchill’s full impact to life.  But the beauty of the film is clear and present. It is actor Gary Oldman’s palpable portrayal of Churchill, showing us an imperfect man who rose to the occasion in horrible times. We see Winston Churchill in full -- tough and brutish on the edges but caring, compassionate, and resolute on the inside. We see him learning to accept and utilize criticism without succumbing to defeat. And best of all, we see and feel Churchill’s connection to his countrymen and women as they enlighten and embolden the man from the inside.  Mega-blasters, sonic booms explosions, and cocky one-liners are abundant in our cinema today. The thirst for such sensationalism even seems to be spilling over into our daily culture as polarization, defensiveness, hatred of one’s political opponents, and self-righteousness abound in real world politics. Today, just as in World War II, Winston Churchill’s combination of virtue, humility, resilience, and ability to break down walls is in short supply. As depicted in Darkest Hour he exhibits unique and exquisite traits that are sorely needed for goodness to prevail.  And that, by definition, makes him a real-life superhero.","5.0 "
"Darkest Hour","Perhaps more fantasy than fact.","Roy R. Platt","""Darkest Hour"" takes place in a fantasy version of 1940 London, where there is no blackout and no tape on all the windows.Although it's a very good film, it could also have been called ""Darkest Film"" as many of the scenes appear to have been filmed in semi-darkness.Also has a rather bizarre bit when Churchill gets out of his car and rides on the Underground.Liked ""Victoria And Abdul"", which we also watched using Amazon Instant Video much better.If you can't decide between ""Victoria And Abdul"" and ""Darkest Hour"" watch ""Victoria And Abdul"".

Oldman's character seems 10 years too old.  This was great acting and a well told story, but it doesn't do justice to Churchill's remarkable stamina and profound intellect, his decisiveness or his wit.

"Darkest Hour","The moment that seperates incompetent from greatness.","TwoDaysAway","Great movie. Well done in many regards. Most striking was the fact that we look at historical figures as the great people they are, but the view is from hindsight. The movie takes you through the development of greatness from someone whom many thought incompetent to the defining moments where a single person, at the right time and place in history, can lead the way. Events change people, they grow or are destroyed. Very inspiring messages. The only dark side is to realize that evil uses many of the same messages as good--so perhaps the movie is also a step in talking about what binds us as a country and way of life that is worth fighting for, no matter what.","5.0 "

"Darkest Hour","Faked subway scene (never actually happened) hurt the movie for me, but, it was mostly ""OK"".","Thucydides","* One Spoiler *I haven't much to add to the other reviews other than to point out that the ""subway scene"" with the ""commoners"" never did occur.  It was all fiction.  And that kind of knocks the props out from under what was supposed to be a major turning point in Churchill's mind whether or not the UK would negotiate with the Nazis, or, refuse to surrender.It was particularly, and obviously, politically-correct nonsense to have had such a 'hovering' presence of a black man constantly appearing in the faked ""subway scene"", as though he was some kind of 'paragon of wisdom' in the whole thing.  What a bunch of PC rubbish, and it was done in such a cheap, obvious way.  Really, it knocked what had been an interesting movie downward considerably.  It would have been a much better, and more truthful movie if they had left the ""subway scene"" out altogether, or simply did it more tastefully and more realistically.Fact: because of Nazi aerial bombing, and U-boat attacks on ships with supplies, Britain had come to a point where in another two weeks, it would have had to sue for peace.  Then, stupidly, the Nazis stopped bombing purely military targets and started just bombing the general population in order to intimidate the English people.  It didn't work..The movie was made with above-average attention to other details, mostly.  The sets and costumes were very believable.  The cinematography was good, as was the directing, generally.  Gary Oldman was acceptable in his portrayal of Churchill, but nothing supernaturally great, as some would have you think.  Actually, much of the supporting cast was every bit as good as Oldman was.All in all, it was almost an ""OK"" movie, and from me that earns two-stars.  It would have been a three-star movie if only they had not cheapened it with that faked, unbelievable ""subway"" scene....","2.0 "

So much of the film depended on the viewer having some prerequisite knowledge about Winston Churchill and the politics of World War II, and my lack thereof played heavily into my lukewarm reaction. And that's my main criticism of the film - as someone who doesn't have an in-depth knowledge of the events portrayed here, it didn't do enough to establish the character of Winston Churchill and help me understand his plight. I spent the majority of the film feeling as though I was passively watching the events unfold, mildly interested at best. It probably doesn't help that political intrigue films tend not to be my cup of tea. In any event, the film certainly looked nice and I absolutely admired and enjoyed Gary Oldman's performance.

Too much of this movie is pure fiction loosely overlaid onto real events.Oldman plays Churchill with none of the vitality that he brought to the early stages of the war and instead plays him as doddering, almost senile.

"Darkest Hour","Showing up at a UK airport might land you in an abusive prison. They're xenophobic and don't like tourists.","consumer32","The Brits would be speaking German it hadn't been for the Americans in WWII. Let me tell you about my darkest hour: When I arrived in London for a rock and roll vacation in 2008 the royalists threw me in prison (""detention"") for two months. I possessed a valid passport but an airport guard fabricated an immigration charge (like I was really planning on an extended stay with pompous snobs, crappy food, and exorbitant prices). I had wanted to do a tour of rock and roll sites, but apparently they don't like the Beatles after all. During my prison vacation prison officials routinely lied to me, insulted me, verbally abused me, and a fat female guard body-slammed me in a hallway because she was bored. In addition, they placed me in more and more restricted cells for no legitimate purpose, as though I required extra punishment for something I didn't do. I was a compliant, educated prisoner. After much hell-raising I finally got an attorney who cut a deal to get me out their immigration prison. All this cost me a lot of money. Just in case you haven't noticed most governments consider committing crimes against prisoners entirely normal. What's a prison for, anyway? The UK is just like the US.","1.0 "

"Darkest Hour","Don't Get It","Donny B.","Sorry, I don't get the buzz around this movie.  Yes, Oldman transformed himself so that he is barely recognizable as Gary Oldman, but he's a poor Churchill.  As an ardent Churchill fan, I have seen much, much better from ""lesser"" actors.  Through out this film, he never approached even a  semblance of the man.  He didn't even have a decent British accent, let alone a good handle on Churchill's particular speech mannerisms.  As for the movie itself - mediocre at best.  The fanciful scene where Churchill takes a subway ride with common Londoner's was a saccharine contrivance.  There are so many more historically accurate ways that Churchill reached out to the common man, especially during the war, that could have better reflected Churchill's character and sense of self.  He certainly would not have taken a one-stop subway ride and then reported his findings back to Parliament.  Among the many Churchill movies I have seen, I would rank this at the very bottom.","1.0 "

But, the real hero is Alan Turing, a man that was intelligent enough to keep the royal family & the country's population safe from Nazi invasion, but wasn't good enough to be treated with respect, decency, & gratefulness, if by no one else, then at least by the Crown, which he is the reason it was kept safe.

"Darkest Hour","A Historical and Dramatic Failure","Larry","I found this movie unconvincing on several levels. Actually I am glad I watched it here and did not try to get into the packed theaters in our area when it was playing.If this is supposed to he history, then I am not sure that the portrayal of Churchill, here or in the partner movie ""Churchill"" is accurate. Was he really so obsessed with Gallipoli that he was scared for all of the men that may be killed here and on D Day. As a kid growing up in Britain I can testify to many issues that made him out to be a heartless monster when it came to non upper class British human life.The scene in the London Underground is fictional. The fact that  a young black man appears there also makes it manipulative. That is not how the underground was or is.If the movie is supposed to have dramatic value, then it also fails. It is boring. The characters are played very stiffly. (Just because you yell at other people because they are using the wrong spacing on a typewriter does not mean that you are giving a meaningful performance.)After the second world war Britain because a cesspool of failed social values, leading to the kind of violence that we have been seeing for the last 60 years. Focused on football matches but also on the streets and in the pubs in general. This movie is typical of the kind of drama that is so popular on PBS with portrayals of upper class genteel individuals with only a side glance to real British people.","1.0 "

"Darkest Hour","A Great Man Stuck With a Studio’s Weak Motive","Trevor's View on Hollywood","First order of business, I say Gary Oldman (The Dark Knight, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) deserves to win the Oscar for Best Actor! The range of his vulnerability as Winston Churchill truly comes out through the fear echoed behind his eyes and voice, a haunting disappearance into the role.All other ways Darkest Hour crafts Churchill should guarantee amazement, starting with the latex prosthetics used to transform Oldman into the man of the hour: a flawless milestone in Hollywood makeup design. Pretty much right away his lesser known arrogant side comes out, especially once he presses his controversial decisions to push the UK’s attack on Nazi, Germany. He publicly flaunts his odd plan by making a V handshape for the reporters, backwards by the way, which he later learns means not victory, but “up your bum.” So the balance between Churchill’s funnier, personal traits and his positive well-known qualities earns its appreciation. Our present age could use a more complete Churchill depiction, a man who shares our president’s most prominent commonalities, both good and bad.Alongside scene-stealer Oldman, the rest of the cast generates desperate, yet compassionate performances, particularly in how the underrated actress Kristin Scott Thomas, (The English Patient) attentively complements Oldman as wife Clementine Churchill.Beyond the people, the technicians also achieve great heights without being too greedy onscreen. Production designer Sarah Greenwood (Anna Karenina, Atonement) recreates the lovely detailed historical setting by enclosing squares and circles upon a pressured Churchill. Likewise, the soft cream colors by cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel (Amélie, Inside Llewyn Davis) set up singular stark backlights to diffuse the overall appearance of what looks like an old historical tape painted by British pride. The feature’s desaturated look soon finds a rupture in its style in the heavy moment of Churchill’s first live speech, when a deep red light floods the room. Then in the post production process, massive letters tick each day by the screen as the lives at Dunkirk are at stake. Everyone's past mental scars can be seen purely by these visual decisions to enhance the feature.Unfortunately, despite the suggested idea of pressure, the meat of the pressure leans too far toward a one-sided British monarchy. Practically no representation goes to the contributors of England's condition beyond some old news footage. The screenplay by Anthony McCarten (The Theory of Everything) does show every character fighting back whatever tough challenge they started together, though you still may want to sit back a little away from the script’s very bad breath. Clementine in particular has a quarter-baked subplot never resolved despite a pre-established anticipation for closure. All the other women either stay chained behind typewriters or at the husband’s bedside, as if cinematic diversity just fell backwards seventy-five years.Like other hopeful Oscar contenders, the attempt to inspire here stretches too hard, especially in the final speech. It’s understandable why it took on a PG-13 rating to appeal to a profitable market, although most teenagers will find it boring, while others may find it predictable, since the script’s fear of national failure triggers an insignificant response from the target audience. Seriously, the potential in Darkest Hour’s kite rides with the wind rather than against it.You can always count on Americans to do the right thing after they’ve tried everything else, except director Joe Wright (Anna Karenina, Pride & Prejudice) lazily relies on historical news footage to establish the era, one of the several examples that demonstrates a small imagination; ironic since Wright attempts to focus in on Churchill’s message of courage.Perfect World Pictures ultimately thinks striking gold will guarantee financial and critical success, with the assumption that the Oscars still set their prioritized sights on British WWII era biopics. Considering the massive change the Academy’s gone through lately in terms of membership, Darkest Hour instead looks desperate alongside its winter release. Therefore, the film’s inner quarrel between the past and present loses sight of the future.As a bonus, in this review, I slipped in three quotes from Winston Churchill and two quotes from Donald Trump. Can you find them?","3.0 "

Churchill, who declared war ON Germany, was a cold, calculating warmonger who eagerly and needlessly brought on the horrific destruction of WWII -- what Ambassador Joseph Kennedy called an ""Armegeddon"" of destruction that killed millions of women and children.  (FDR fired ambassador Kennedy for his honesty and preference for peace.)

He really looks the part and for people who are not familiar with Churchill's, voice which I'm old enough to be very familiar with,  Oldman simply does not capture the voice at all.  Churchill's was much deeper.  It spoils it for me and I love movies about Churchill.","2.0 "

"Darkest Hour","You Never Know What Can Happen Yesterday!","Mark Rufo","A movie is a movie, and history is history, and the two are never the same.  People go to the movies (or rent them or buy them) to see a movie. So, let's consider ""Darkest Hour"" as a film drama. Suppose England is an imaginary country and it is threatened by a monster.  Because the English are ""good"" (we see almost everything from their perspective) we want a hero to save them after a suitable period of ups and downs to  hold our interest. Well, nothing wrong with that!  And here we have an interesting hero: an old fat man who drinks booze with his breakfast (always served in bed!) and smokes cigars constantly. But he has to be a hero for us also - that is for Americans of 2018. So he runs his mouth off when he ought to shut up, and is rude to people who can't even defend themselves and he makes obscene gestures in front of the press. He is also more than occasionally delusional. (Gosh, why does this sound familiar?) Also although he has come to power under circumstances that seem inexplicable, he is opposed by the Establishment, which would like to get rid of him.  (I know I've seen this somewhere before and recently!)So where is our story going? You know where it is going. You've seen enough movies. We need a happy ending!  And as sure as Christ died for your sins you are going to get one.This film is actually quite good - better than I expected - for most of the way through. But to get that happy ending we have to go all silly. This happens late in the movie when Churchill decides to ride the underground (the District Line) and gets to talk to real people - including a token Negro!  The idiocy of this scene has to be witnessed to be believed.By the way, whatever did happen to the British Empire? The real Churchill in his most famous speech said it should last for a thousand years. Kind of like that other empire that you-know-who was trying to build.","3.0 "

"Happy Death Day","Like Groundhog Day, but with stabbings","H. Bala","Thanks to more ""horrory"" horror movies like Split and Get Out and It, quirky horror-adjacent movies like Happy Death Day and The Lure didn't get as much shine in 2017. If you haven't seen The Lure, go see it. It's a critically acclaimed comic horror-musical from Polish director Agnieszka Smoczynska. But we're here to talk about Happy Death Day.It's a slasher flick, only it's very tongue-in-cheek and self-aware and very funny. It's a take on the time loop conceit. It's as if Groundhog Day and D.O.A. got drunk, messed around, and had a baby.Really big ups to lead actress, Jessica Rothe, who takes an insufferable character and renders her sympathetic and rootable. She plays Tree Gelbman, one of those mean popular girls we seem to always run into in those high school or college flicks. At Bayfield U, she's so horrible to everyone. She just threw shade at a guy she recently dated: ""I mean, who takes their first date to Subway? It's not like you had a footlong."" So mean! But I laughed very hard. Just last night, Tree got boozed up, cavorted on a table, instigated two fights, and barfed mightily.Next day. September 18, a Monday, would turn out to be the longest day in Tree's life. Day starts with her waking up in a stranger's dorm room. Day ends with her getting brutally murdered! And it happens on her birthday.But then Tree wakes up the next day, only to find she's reliving the same day. And she keeps waking up to this same day. And no matter how much she changes the beats and pattern of that day, it still ends with her getting murdered. Over and over again. Sometimes, there's nothing more scary than a baby in a hoodie.I suspected I was in for a good time from when they messed around with the Universal Pictures logo at the opening. No, Happy Death Day isn't your baseline horror flick. It's smart and inventive. It packs in sly humor but never allows it to get in the way of telling a decent thriller. For the gorehounds, this may disappoint as it's PG-13 and while there are scary jolts and some very nasty kills, it's not that gory and grotesque. Most times, the camera cuts away before we see the actual kill. However, the chase sequences are blocked to make them as pulse-pounding as possible. Going into the movie, I had a notion that maybe I'd get tired of the MC getting killed over and over and over. But there's enough variety in how she repeatedly gets her ticket punched that it never got old.The terrific Rothe is supported by a solid young cast. I'd never heard of any of them, but none of them bring the movie down. I liked Rothe's chemistry with Israel Broussard who plays Carter. Carter seems like such a good dude he right away became my number one suspect. But Broussard and Rothe are sweet together.This paragraph is probably spoilery so feel free to skip ahead. I really liked the twist of Rothe's previous ""rewind"" days exacting a cumulative physical toll on her body. All the damage she'd accrued makes her progressively weaker each time she revives. There IS a point of no return. No choice for Tree but to turn detective and unmask her killer.There was an idea... to bring together a group of remarkable time loop films... If Kevin Feige were to quit Marvel, maybe he can launch a new shared universe. Imagine if Happy Death Day were part of a shared universe that comprised the likes of Edge of Tomorrow, Source Code, Run Lola Run, Salvage, 12:01, the ""Monday"" episode from X-Files, and, yes, Groundhog Day. I don't know how that'll work because it's for damn sure a wiggy concept, but I call it the Déjà Vu universe.One more possibly spoilery thing. I did figure out whodunit. The clue that gave it away is in the car chase sequence.","5.0 "

"Happy Death Day","BEST CAT AND MOUSE HORROR FILM IN YEARS","Nicholas D. Laha","This is one of those films that you look at the cover, and think this is going to be pretty lame, same old crap.  But then you watch it and it knocks your socks off and takes you by total surprise.  If you are a true horror fan, and are judging this movie by its cover, buy it, buy it, buy it totally original, and interesting movie to add to your collection I repeat its not what you think.  Only true horror fans will get what I just meant by that.  This movie actually reminds me of another recent movie, not because its similar in style, not by a long shot, but because of the statement it made when it came out IE THE BEST HORROR FILM OF THE 21ST CENTURY, and then fell flat on its face, what is that movie, oh I can't remember , oh yes DON'T BREATHE.  In the cat and mouse style of horror genre, this one however HITS THE MARK, 1. THE MOST ORIGINAL PLOT I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS, IN FACT THIS IS A FIRST OF ITS KIND.  2.  KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT AND THE SCARES AND QUESTIONS AND PLOT TWISTS COME A MILE A MINUTE.  3.  THE MOST ORIGINAL CAT AND MOUSE HORROR STORY IN YEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That's all I am going to say, to good of a movie to give anything away.  For the true fans out there and to pay homage to that other movie I talked about all I can say is don't make a sequel, don't make a new movie, JUST, DON'T BREATHE, HAPPY DEATH DAY.  Enjoy","5.0 "

"Happy Death Day","""Groundhog Day"" Gets The Slasher Treatment","PennWriter","""Groundhog Day"" gets the slasher treatment, and it's just as enjoyable as it sounds.When bitter college student Tree finds herself living the same day over and over, and getting killed by a masked villain each time, she is forced to try and discover their identity and stop them to escape her nightmare. In many ways, the film hits the same story beats as the Bill Murray classic, with Tree eventually having to confront who she really is and finding it in herself to be a better person, but it also puts its own twists on the time loop - notably, that Tree gets weaker each time she dies, leaving her with only a finite number of ""lives"" to thwart her killer. The killer's identity and motives do a feel a touch too underwhelming - though, that's kinda part of the joke - and for once, I would have liked an explanation for the time loop rather than just the symbolism of her birthday being the day she's stuck in. But honestly, these are nitpicks . . . . overall, ""Happy Death Day"" is a suspenseful, exciting and even funny horror flick that treats itself just seriously enough to feel genuine while having enough fun to keep things from getting too dark.","4.0 "

"Happy Death Day","Better than expected!","Rich Whitcomb","Happy Death Day is a knockoff of Edge Of Tomorrow and Before I Fall, but at least all these movies have different stories to them.  Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) has to relive every day in order to find her killer.  The one thing I was really happy about and delighted to see in this movie that was new and not a knockoff was that, every time she died and woke up the next day, her body would be in a little worse shape instead of just reliving every day like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day.  I know you might think that I just gave away a big spoiler, but trust me, I didn't.  I would suggest this movie, but only as a rental or maybe borrow it from your friend if they have it.  It's definitely not one you will want to watch over and over, but maybe once or twice a year if you're a true movie lover.  I hope my review helped you decide on what to do as far as watching it goes.","3.0 "

Then she wakes up and repeats the day until she figures out she has to find her killer and change her life. there were a couple things i didnt like **SPOILERS** they didnt explain why she kept repeating her day but its kind of implied it was to change who she is but still. and the doctor told her her injuries should of killed her in one loop but that wasnt touched upon again. other than that, it was a great movie.terrific not forced humor and a  nice twist at the end to but the motive was a bit silly but still a good suspense movie. think Groundhog day meets Scream. I also saw the Alternate ending on the digital and be glad they did not use that ending. everyone would of been pissed. lol!","4.0 "
"Happy Death Day","Groundhog Day (1993) meets Scream (1996) in this surprisingly entertaining and FUN college slasher.","John's Horror Corner","I have to admit, I didn’t necessarily expect this to be more than an entertaining (if good) little horror flick with a feisty gimmick playfully riffing on a favorite ‘90s comedy: Groundhog Day (1993).  But little did I know, this film was directed by one of the writers of Paranormal Activity 2-3 (2010-2011; also 4 and Marked Ones, but I was less a fan of them) and the outstanding teen thriller Disturbia (2007).  Director Christopher Landon (Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse) has the gifts of sophomoric humor, mature slow-building tension, and well-invested characters that earn audience sympathy.  All three find themselves well-married in this actually quite delightful horror movie!The plot is simple (especially if you’ve seen Groundhog Day): a college student relives the day of her murder over and over again in a cycle presumably only broken by preventing her own death.  That hapless victim is Tree (Jessica Rothe; The Tribe, Parallels), and her day repeatedly starts with awakening in a strange dorm room with a major hangover and no recollection of the night before.The Groundhog Day callbacks are frequent, clearly deliberate (as indicated in the last few minutes of the film), and I delight in them!  Those familiar with the 1993 comedy will envision Bill Murray throwing his bedside radio, killing himself, eating with reckless abandon, predicting random events, being mean, being nice, being hypercognitive…I smiled a lot watching this.  Tree’s relationships with those she encounters on her time-looped birthday radically shift from normal, to confused, to paranoid, to slapstick, to constructive.The writing was solid, the camerawork was good, the pacing was great, I liked the story…I have (honestly) no complaints.  I also thought the cast all did great!  Some notables from the cast include Israel Broussard, Ruby Modine and Rachel Matthews.  Oh, and Jessica Rothe knocked it outta’ the park!  The repetition of the day’s events give us ample opportunity to flesh out characters presented to us in the context of a First Act—which was really cool.For the squeamish, this film will be fine.  There’s a bit of blood and no real gore.  Rather than relying on shock-cinema gore stylings, this film rides the wave of dreading Tree’s next encounter with her killer…and it all works well!  She never encounters the killer the same way twice (which actually makes sense in the end) and we are often edgy about just whom the killer actually is.  There’s also quite of bit of Scream -esque (1996) humor stitched between the suspense.We even find a lot of non-comedic humor in the irony and awkwardness of reliving the same events again and again.  It’s all rather charming and, much to my surprise, manages to proceed uninhibited by the killer’s odd baby-faced mask.I’m gonna’ say it.  This movie was delightful.  It was a lot of fun, had a fair balance of jumps and legit tension, the story was engaging and the delivery was self-aware.  Highly recommended, probably highly rewatchable as well, and I intend to buy it.  Enjoy!","5.0 "

"Happy Death Day","A clever resetting of ""Groundhog Day"" for the horror genre","Paul Allaer","""Happy Death Day"" (2017 release; 96 min.) brings the story of Theresa (""Tree"")'s birthday. As the movie opens, she wakes up not knowing where she is (a guy's dorm room). Her phone tells her it's Monday. September 18, her birthday no less. The guy is Carter, with whom Tree partied the night before. Theresa takes the walk of shame back to her sorority house, where her sorority sisters are curious about the mystery guy she fell for. Later that evening, when Tree is going to another party, she is followed by a creepy baby-masked guy, who eventually stabs and kills her. Immediately, Tree wakes up and it's again Monday, September 18, 9:01 am. What is going on here? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest horror movie of director Christopher Landon, who previously also directed ""Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones"", among others. Here Landon, working from a script by Scott Lobdell, essentially revisits ""Groundhog Day"" for the horror genre. Set on the beautiful (fictional) campus of Bayfield University, Tree has an even worse day than Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, as she knows that each day will end in death. Why is this happening to her? How can she make it stop? And who is the killer? These are the questions we want answered, and keep us guessing. The movie's got a nice rhythm to it, and there are some funny moments too. In the movie's very first seconds, the Universal musical theme starts, and restarts, and restarts again, a clever ode and sing of things to come. The movie is helped immensely by the likeable Jessica Rothe, here in a leading (and break-out) role as Tree. She leads a cast of mostly no-names, and that suits this film perfectly fine. At a certain point, Tree lands in the hospital, and the doctor examining her concludes ""Technically you should be dead"", ha! Considering this movie's production budget was less than $5 million, a mere peanuts in Hollywood these days, this movie is bound to be successful no matter what.""Happy Death Day"" opened wide this weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely (although not quite a sell-out). There is a good reason this movie is rated PG-13 It is MILES away from the all-out horror-porn that you find in the ""Saw"" franchise (which is rebooting later this month with ""JigSaw"") and similar over the top movies. ""Death Happy Valley"" is clever, sometimes scary, other times funny, always fast-paced, and before you know it the hour and a half has come and gone just like that. I encourage you to check it out,. be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","4.0 "

"Happy Death Day","Surprisingly good and emotional","titania86","Tree wakes up on a normal day in a stranger's dorm room. She goes about her day generally being rude to people and dismissive of others until she's on her way to a party. A music box is set in the middle of a tunnel surrounded by construction lights and barriers. A baby masked killer stabs her to death and then she wakes up right back in that strange dorm room on the same day. This day, she makes it to the party, but also is stabbed to death while techno music blasts and no one can hear her screams. Tree has to find out who her killer is so she can see tomorrow.Happy Death Day takes the concept of Groundhog's Day and gives it a horror twist with emotional weight. Tree starts out as a pretty odious person who doesn't really care about anyone but herself. She goes through her day kind of like a wrecking ball, ruining people's days and putting people down left. It can be as small as refusing to smile at a sorority sister or it can be as big as refusing to acknowledge ghosting someone she dated or sleeping with her married professor. It only takes her two days to figure out that she has to do something different and it isn't just deja vu. She starts by trying to figure out who keeps killing her, but she also changes how she goes about her day. It doesn't matter where she goes or what she does; the baby masked killer always finds her. Tree makes a suspect list and marks each person off when she finds they’re innocent.Tree has a lot going on underneath her facade especially about her birthday which she didn’t want to tell anyone about. She shares it with hr mother, who she was close to and who died. After her mother’s death, her personality changed and she became the callous and unfeeling person she is today. Repeating the day over and over made her face the awful decisions and actions that come naturally now. Over time, she decides to smile at her sorority sister, break up with her married boyfriend, stand up to her awful sorority sister, start over with her roommate, encourage the closted gay man trying to date her, and reconnect with her father. When she finally arrives at dinner with her father, Tree is honest with him instead of pretending everything is fine. Her birthday makes her sad and lost because of the loss of her mother. The scene is very sweet and emotional when Tree finally shares her feelings and acknowledges their shared loss.A sweet romance starts between Tree and Carter, the owner of the dorm where she wakes up every morning. Even though she’s mean to him, he always treats her with kindness and understanding. She assumes they had sex, but he reveals halfway through the movie that he let her sleep in his bed while he took his roommates’s bed because she was drunk. Every day he gives her advice and doesn’t act like her experience is totally insane. Carter even sacrifices himself to protect her from the killer. Tree thought she might beat the killer at that point, but opts to kill herself instead to make sure he’s alive when time finally moves forward. I usually hate romances in teen horror, but this one was adorable and well done.Happy Death Day was so much better than I ever expected. The cyclical day is never explained. The killer is almost supernaturally good at tracking Tree’s movements and killing her in a variety of ways including stabbing, poisoning, and most spectacularly being blown up in a car. Their identity comes as a surprise. The reason for the killing is not great, pointed out by Tree, but people kill for dumb reasons all the time. I also didn't even notice that it was a PG-13 movie. The stakes were high and the violence didn't pull punches. It's definitely worth a watch.","5.0 "
"Happy Death Day","SO MANY TWISTS YOUR HEAD WILL BE SPINNING!","PR GUY","Awesome! So many twists your head will be spinning!  Great suspense, humor, casting and editing.  I bought this because it was created by the same producer as ""Get Out!"" - the flick that is up for an Oscar for Best film and Best Actor.  This one is amazing.  I had no clue how it was going to end and there were a couple of moments where I nearly jumped out of my skin.  It plays out more like a Hitchcock or Stephen King film...keeps you thinking, in suspense and chuckling all along the way.  A must in this genre.  All 5 stars.  Definitely, all 5 stars.","5.0 "
"Happy Death Day","Surprisingly good horror comedy","Joseph M. Reninger","Tree (Jessica Rothe) is a spoiled sorority girl who wakes up in some strange guy's dormitory bed. She's hung over and doesn't remember the guy's name, and doesn't particularly care either. She's unpleasant to a bunch of people she mets on her walk of shame back to the sorority. She has an antagonistic exchange with her best friend their and dumps the cupcake her roommate made for her in the trash. Tree is not a nice young woman. She get her comeuppance in the most horrible way possible: She's murdered on the night of her birthday. If that wasn't bad enough, she wakes up in the same dormitory bed and has to relive the day over and over again with the same ending--death by a masked killer. Is the only way out killing the killer before the killer kills her? She's so rude and selfish to people, the list of suspects is practically everyone on campus.This premise may sound like an exceptionally dark take on Groundhog Day. A lot of modern horror movies do go for a pessimistic view, often with a ""no win"" ending for the protagonist. Happily, this movie's tone is much lighter and it takes the redemption of the main character seriously. She is really unlikeable at the beginning, she does realize she is a horrible person, she does take steps to be a better person. Instead of always doing the selfish, easy things, she starts to do much harder and more selfless actions, partly in hope of solving her murder but also in recognition that a morally better life is a happier life. Pain and sorrow are not unavoidable but they can have a healing quality that Tree recognizes. The story turns out to be perfectly in tune with Groundhog Day's message.This movie isn't as great as Groundhog Day but it does have good thematic similarities and a lot of attention to detail. Similar events throughout the day are given enough variation (either through different camera work or different actions by Tree) that the film doesn't become monotonous or predictable. Other than her dying every time, of course. The deaths are also not as gruesomely depicted (the movie is PG-13), which keeps the tone lighter. The movie makers are certainly aware of the tropes of slasher films (Tree is stalked in a tunnel, in a hospital hallway, in a parking garage, etc.) and uses them well. While it has tense moments it isn't particularly scary. It is immensely enjoyable.Recommended as a surprisingly upbeat and well-crafted horror film.Parental warning: In addition to some non-grisly death scenes (mostly she's stabbed but not with lot of blood), the characters use a moderate bit of swearing, including one f-bomb presumably to ensure the PG-13 rating. There's some mild kissing scenes and one naked walk of shame without any private parts showing. One student turns out to be gay and Tree encourages that character to be open about it.","4.0 "
"Happy Death Day","A useless bratty girl, gets a heart and soul; like a filthy grackle that rises from the ashes as a classy Phoenix.","Amazon Customer","I will buy this DVD at some point.  The reviews [at another site] were mixed, so I wasn't sure what I'd be seeing.  In the end this film came through.  ""Happy Death Day"" is not original in its use of re-living a day over and over. Though it handled that [Over-and 0ver, vehicle] better then any I've ever seen before.  (I kept thinking: ""Oh, they're going to mess it up this way, or that."" But ""Happy Death Day"", always came through.)  Along with the excellent script the other aspects of the film were great- acting, direction, pace, cinematography...  Little things which are, usually, missed were taken into account.  The main character- who was a useless brat- grew up and developed a real personality.  Had her character, truly, been killed off in the first half hour we- the audience- would have been thankful.  But, as she grew, in character and personality, I really started to like her and care about her.  The main character was a dynamic, thinking individual [after she stopped being a useless brat] that realized her action had ramifications.  There is a bit of mystery and twists that appear in:  ""Happy Death Day"".  This comes off as a comedy [I think] but it's a serious comedy; like ""Drowning Mona"".  If you looking for a good solid movie with an intelligent thinking aspect; then this is a very good choice.","4.0 "
"Happy Death Day","Love, Comedy, Horror, Redemption all in a one-stop rollercoaster ride!!!","R. Smith","One of the best horror/love/comedy/suspense movies out in last few years. Jessica Rothe is an amazing actress, and the entire cast supports her performance in true stellar fashion.Character development is central to this movie, and it is very nicely done. At first, I wanted to kill the main character because she came across as such a vile little snip! But by the end of the movie, I found I fell in love with her....and that's saying a lot for the production because I ain't sappy like that...normally. This is a feel-good movie that gets you there by dragging you through agonizing horror and suspense.I don't want to build it up too much...just know that it is a top-notch production from writing, to direction, to acting, to the soundtrack, to the very end credits. Amazingly satisfying film! I erred in thinking I might not like it, so I rented it. Now I am going to buy it because: THAT GOOD!The only downside to this is something one of the One Star Wonder Reviewers mentioned, and that is the recurring day device or deja vu sequences that harken back to Groundhog Day.I was going to ding it for that, BUT, after seeing it I realized it is NOTHING LIKE Groundhog Day.Also, at the end, there is a reference made to Groundhog Day which kind of acknowledged that the movie makers knew that would be an issue for some people. So, I totally accept their use of the device, forgive them for biting GHD a little bit. It was WORTH IT!(There is another movie that uses that device too...what was it...50 First Dates? With Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler?)","5.0 "
"Happy Death Day","...And Many More...","DCHagy","""Happy Death Day"" was a nice surprise for me.  Being marketed as a horror ""Groundhog Day,"" HDD tells a story of a young women who keeps having the same dream over and over and over and over. Trouble is, in her dream she is always killed (and some of them very nasty kills).  It seems she must solve her own ""dream"" murder or be forever doomed to relive it every day.I thought the pacing, acting, and directing were above-average for this type of film.  Jessica Rothe (from ""La La Land"") plays the heroine in peril, Tree with a convincing style.  Her supporting players are all well cast and (to me) you can tell everybody seemed to be having a good time.  That's a nice change of pace since most involved in this genre of film always seem to be constipated.Will Tree be able to break her cycle of being repeatedly murdered?  Can she look past the obvious to find out who is doing this to her?  Who will survive and what will be left of them?  Uh, wait...Rated PG-13 with sexual situations, language, and violence.  I say check this one out!","4.0 "
"Happy Death Day","Well done","Wicingas","I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. Even if the plot is a rewind and there are formula moments, it was well acted and well scripted. Every repeat day was not exactly like the day before as the young lady evolved throughout the story and in her efforts not to be killed again. Her quest to solve her own murder took on different twists with each day as she tried to figure things out. Her varied moods with each day were well portrayed. The humor as the story evolved was well done. Perhaps the most important facet of the movie is that she begins to confront her own self-centered attitude to find out there is a genuine person within. There is an alternate ending that I did not care for, probably because that is exactly how I envisioned the movie ending. I really liked the ending they gave it.","4.0 "

"Happy Death Day","Am I in a dorm room?","The Movie Guy","As you may already know, this is ""Groundhog's Day"" plus a slasher. Teresa (Jessica Rothe) is a coed who makes the rounds. In any horror slasher she would never be the final girl and typically the first one to die. In this film she is indeed the first one to die only to wake up again to relive her birthday again...and die again. She formulates a plan to find out the identity of the killer who wears a baby mask.The film was cute and clever. Jessica Rothe is not new to horror, having been in ""La La Land"" which would have been better had they killed people early and often instead of letting Emma Stone die a slow and agonizing death. Please God, don't let her sing again. Well worth a view for those who adore comedy horror. Loved the twist.Guide: Caught 1 F-word. No sex or nudity. Minor groping.

It is similar to the old ""Groundhog Day"" movie starring Bill Murray but with a twist. Personally, I loved it. Don't pass on this one because of the title.

"Happy Death Day","Groundhog Day (1993) meets Scream (1996) in this surprisingly entertaining and FUN college slasher.","John's Horror Corner","I have to admit, I didn’t necessarily expect this to be more than an entertaining (if good) little horror flick with a feisty gimmick playfully riffing on a favorite ‘90s comedy: Groundhog Day (1993).  But little did I know, this film was directed by one of the writers of Paranormal Activity 2-3 (2010-2011; also 4 and Marked Ones, but I was less a fan of them) and the outstanding teen thriller Disturbia (2007).  Director Christopher Landon (Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse) has the gifts of sophomoric humor, mature slow-building tension, and well-invested characters that earn audience sympathy.  All three find themselves well-married in this actually quite delightful horror movie!The plot is simple (especially if you’ve seen Groundhog Day): a college student relives the day of her murder over and over again in a cycle presumably only broken by preventing her own death.  That hapless victim is Tree (Jessica Rothe; The Tribe, Parallels), and her day repeatedly starts with awakening in a strange dorm room with a major hangover and no recollection of the night before.The Groundhog Day callbacks are frequent, clearly deliberate (as indicated in the last few minutes of the film), and I delight in them!  Those familiar with the 1993 comedy will envision Bill Murray throwing his bedside radio, killing himself, eating with reckless abandon, predicting random events, being mean, being nice, being hypercognitive…I smiled a lot watching this.

"Happy Death Day","A Delightful Surprise","Carl Schultz","A movie with a title like this, starring a cast of young people and released on a Friday the 13th just prior to Halloween, would generally indicate a lurid little horror picture produced to exploit the season, lure in the weekend date audience, and make a quick killing at the box office.  It’s happened dozens of times before.But “Happy Death Day” turns out to be a delightful surprise—a genuinely original little picture which doesn’t take itself too seriously, and has some fun with the horror genre by combining with it elements of suspense, exploitation, and comedy, in a manner which is both highly original and vastly entertaining, even to wary adults.In “Happy Death Day,” a college sorority girl is murdered by a masked assailant during the evening of her birthday, but begins the day again at the moment of her death, and relives the fateful birthday over and over.  Eventually she not only attempts to identify her killer and save her own life, but also undertakes a healthy regimen of self-improvement.Imagine a hybrid combining elements of “Halloween,” “A Christmas Carol,” and “Back to the Future” with a heaping dose of “Groundhog Day”—a movie knowingly referenced throughout the picture—and you won’t be too far off.Written with originality and enormous good humor by Scott Lobdell and directed with style, confidence, and polish by Christopher Landon, “Happy Death Day” features a terrific performance by Jessica Rothe as the unfortunate murder victim, supported by Israel Broussard as a casual romantic partner who becomes a bewildered Watson to her Holmes.And audiences seem to be responding to the picture—during its opening weekend, “Happy Death Day” earned over $31 million in box office receipts on an investment of a little under $5 million, easily taking the top spot at the box office.This is one motion picture surprise which is enjoyable enough to bear sequels.  In fact, the planning for a first sequel has already begun.","3.0 "

"Happy Death Day","Not a Best Movie Contender of the Year, but Still Enjoyable","HolyJIEbus","Horror Movie Review (7/10) “Good” (Non-spoiler)Director: Christopher LandonWriter: Scott LobdellStarring: Jessica Rothe (Tree Gelbman), Israel Broussard (Carter Davis)Plot: A college student must relive the day of her murder over and over again, in a loop that may end only when she discovers her killer's identity.Review: Think Bill Murray’s ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) mixed with Wes Craven’s ""Scream"" (1996) and you get ""Happy Death Day"". There is even a reference to Groundhog's Day within this movie, in sort of a meta way to show that the creators were thinking the same thing. If you watched the trailers that came out for this movie, then you know exactly what you are getting into as the trailers tell the premise of the movie pretty accurately. I was actually looking forward to this movie because of the premise, and since one of my favorite comic book writers (Scott Lobdell of “Red Hood and the Outlaws,” “Teen Titans”, “Superman,” i.e.) was behind the screenplay I had high hopes walking into this movie.I think what helps this movie be enjoyable the most is Jessica Rothe’s performance as Tree. We see her for 90% of this movie, and if the main actor did not deliver, this movie could’ve easily fallen apart. I appreciated her change from douchebag college student to a more caring person as she came to realize what a horrible person she has been to her father, her friends, her boyfriend(s), etc. Everyone was good in this movie, but clearly Rothe was the stand out actress and she was believable as someone you despised, yet grew to empathize with throughout the course of the movie.This movie won’t leave you in tears or might not really make you feel different about the world, but it’s fun and seeing Rothe trying to find out who the killer was while reliving her death over and over again was enjoyable.   ","4.0 "

"Happy Death Day","Absolutely implausible, bonkers and silly, but Happy Death Day does its job pretty darn well","Cameron","Happy Death Day is a horror slasher movie directed by Christopher B. Landon. What if you have multiple lives and the chance to solve your own murder mystery? College sorority girl, Tree wakes up in a stranger's bed after a night of hard partying. She has a headache, does not know where she is, leaves dorm room, goes about her day encountering numerous people whom she interacts with, and then at night she is murdered by a masked killer. But there is no light at the end of the tunnel however, instead the very next moment Tree wakes up in the same stranger's bed to relive the same day over again. This concept has been done before, the last notable one being Edge of Tomorrow, but this time instead of aliens, we get a slasher. I find the movie in general to be very enjoyable. It was surprisingly fun and effective, with the right balance of humor, scares and character development.The best thing about the movie besides the awesome concept is definitely how funny and light-hearted it was. Most of the humor stems from Tree knowing exactly what is going to happen each cycle, much to bewilderment of her surrounding characters. The concept, even though it is not new, is refreshing to see it being applied to a teen horror film. It is fascinating to witness Tree experiencing the same thing over and over again but with all previous knowledge intact and seeing how she learns and grows as a person. In the beginning she is mean and terrible and just the biggest jerk to everyone, but by the end of the film, she more than softens up. Jessica Rothe as Tree was multi-faceted; she was sassy, funny, courageous and sympathetic in her portrayal.The mystery of the killer's identity is another part of the fun. The film introduces a bunch of characters in the first loop, many whom are red herrings for the audience to suspect. In the end I failed to guess who the killer was since the film deployed multiple misdirection to make sure the secret is preserved. All the characters are very entertaining and it felt like I was an active participant in the uncovering of the mystery. One character I particularly liked was Carter, the schoolmate of whose room Tree wakes up in. Their romance was something I could easily cling on thus by default, the heart of the film.While the killer reveal was surprising, the more I thought about it the more it does not really make sense. The killer would have had ample chances to kill Tree thus his/her master plan just seemed very unnecessary by the end. The PG-13 rating also did the movie no justice as it felt like a handcuff of what they could have displayed. Horror films, especially slashers should be given the liberty of showing maximum violence, and in that respect Happy Death was a little bit on the dry side. Although the buildups were suspenseful and the jump scares effective, with one catching me pretty good, the movie was not terribly scary.Overall Happy Death Day is a pretty enjoyable horror flick with an interesting concept and a very good performance from the lead actress. I was not bored for even a second because of how fun it was. Yes, it is absolutely implausible, bonkers and silly, but if you are looking for some cheap thrills and a reason to crack a smile, Happy Death Day does its job pretty darn well.","3.0 "

"Happy Death Day","2 1/2 stars for a lame take on ""Groundhog Day"" with a ""Mean Girl"" quasi-horror twist.","M. Oleson","Possible spoilers.  As I write this review it is Groundhog Day, 2018.  I only mention this because this is yet another take on the Bill Murray classic “Groundhog Day” movie from 1993.  Not only is this film a quasi-horror version of Murray’s dramedy, it isn’t the first of the genre or even the first from 2017.  That would be “Before I Fall” which is also a better film.  Both feature a high school/college age “Mean Girl” in the feature role.  One that gets killed, but wakes up the next day…but it’s the same day to live over and die again.Our girl here is Teresa “Tree” Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) who lives in the snootiest of snootiest sororities.  One where the sisters will attack another just for drinking chocolate milk.  I’m sure it is just a coincidence that this sister is black and her agitators aren’t.  Actually, Tree is something of a loner herself.  She doesn’t seem to get along with anyone.  She drinks a lot, bed’s some of the sister’s boyfriends, one of her married college professors and just about anyone else it would seem.  That includes Carter Davis (Israel Broussard), who lives in a dorm (the horror).She wakes up after a night of heavy drinking in Carter’s room sleeping in his roommate’s bed.  Realizing what she must have done (having sex with a dormer), she quickly dresses and leaves without even asking Carter his name.  Think that will change and the story moves along?  That night on the way to another party (I noticed that she doesn’t carry a purse, a clutch or even a phone), Tree is confronted by a lumbering character dressed in all black, with a hoody and face mask of a baby.  The masks are being distributed on campus as some form of school spirit.  Yeah, I didn’t get that either.  She’s stabbed to death.  And wakes up back in Carter’s room, only to go through it again and again and again, etc.Thankfully the director Christopher Landon and writer Scott Lobdell at least change how she dies each time.  In one of her days where she is spending time with Carter, he suggest that she must figure out who the killer is before she can break the daily do-over.  So Tree goes into detective mode.  Not only that, she realizes this can’t go on forever and decides to become a decent human being again.  The filmmakers misdirect us a few times before Tree figures out who the killer is.  The killer is, well let’s just say, hardly a likely suspect both in terms of intent and physical characteristics.  But that is the least of the problems of the movie.How Tree will react to her various daily journeys are easy to calculate.  On a positive note, Ms. Rothe is very good and mostly carries the film on her own.  Hopefully she’ll get some better options in the future.","3.0 "

This film never stops surprising you","penname","Quick Story Recap:  A woman whose daughter was raped and murdered does her best to try and find or force the police to find the murderer.Acting was great.  The casting department did a wonderful job getting the talent on this film.  Frances McDormand was killing it in every scene.  I enjoyed her work.  But everyone looks the part too of small town people.Wow - That's my visceral response while seeng the credits roll.  I think the film does an amazing job with pulling you into the story from the moment you see what's on the billboards and keeps you with all the twists.  I love that all the characters were well defined in their actions, reactions, and dialogue.  The strength of the character motivations is the backbone of the film, if they weren't well defined none of the surprises and twists would have been effective.  OK, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FILM SPECIFICALLY SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!  For  most of the movie, I suspected and hoped the murderer was Dixon but I'm glad I got to see him sort of redeemed. This film does such a good job of making the audience sympathetic to each characters situation at some point in the film (It takes a while for any sympathy for Dixon, but i feel he gets there).  And since you really understand each character and their struggle, you, as the audience member get easily torn into which side would you be on, and I admired that the movie could make me feel conflicted especially in the moment of the billboard discussion on the swings between Mildred and Sheriff Whelliby. . I'll admit there were some unrealistic things, seems like Mildred would be been in prison for arson I don't think cops would just let her off especially given her comments to the chief following the billboard fire  he would have so much reason to think she did it. I can't believe Mildred kicked not one but two students in the groin!! haha!  Yes, in reality that would have been more problematic for her too.  Hard to say if Dixon would have had jail time for his assault of Wellby - in reality we still have a hard time convicting cops who shoot unarmed people so I don' t know what would have happened there besides maybe a lawsuit and a payout to Welby. While I wished for Mildred to get justice I'm glad the movie doesn't, I think they made the right choice even if I had hope the bar guy was it.  I loved former Officer Dixon's las few lines of the film, ""who else would have?""  it added a needed moment of levity that drew a laugh and helped the final moments of the film for the audience to know Mildred and Dixon weren't really going to murder someone  --- while Mildred and Dixon have both done terrible things in the course of the film,  This moment capitalized that they aren't really bad deep down.  I loved this film and plan on buying the DVD.","4.0 "
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","If you get Flannery O'Connor, you'll get this film","Lynn Dion","This film is just about flawless, including the ending, but if you go in looking for conventional justice and simple structures you will be quite uncomfortable with it. I think the film makers dealt a fleeting but broad hint in the scene where Mildred first meets Red Welby to order the billboard service. Look at what he is reading when she comes in. The whole cast of characters, including an array of good but flawed men, responds to the psychology and emotional life of these stories. Some of them, including Willoughby and Welby, are intelligent enough to be aware of it, and others, like Dixon, are just visceral actors on a stage they can't recognize.  Doesn't hurt to get into the guts of this town and not try to hover above it making sense from outside. For one thing, towns like this elected the president . . . but that's not really what I want to emphasize. Meanwhile, this ensemble is stronger than almost anything you have seen, and it's a breakthrough for all of them on that level. Even Abby Cornish, odd casting choice at first blush, and her portrayal are there to tell you much, much about her husband and his one of a kind character, indirectly and eccentrically. This is brilliant work if you let it in.","5.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","I’m in a minority here","Rubykiddo","I found this movie truly awful and I don’t often find movies I was looking forward to seeing disappoint me to such an extent. I’m not sure what all the fuss about was for the performances.  I’ve seen Frances McDormand better. As for the other characters, calling them stereotypes would actually be a compliment, they all seemed a bit phony and trivial. Definitely came across as a movie written by a playwright and nothing against live theater, but whenever I see plays, I’m never quite as immersed, performances more often than not are played “louder” & that makes it difficult to suspend disbelief and the realization that you’re watching a performance.  Unlike film, plays can’t benefit from editing which usually is able to piece together the intensity & subtleties of  performances and give them the necessary believability. How was that not achieved here? Nothing about these performances seemed genuine.  For me, a bleeding heart softie that is pretty easily emotionally manipulated by film (and even a few tv commercials), I wasn’t stirred in the least for McDormand’s loss. I also found the flashbacks a pretty cheap and beginner tactic to telling a story. Someone that liked this film compared it to a Flaherty O’Connor story. Nope! Another reviewer who hated this said it seemed like a movie written by a European. I’d agree, it misses in enough places where it was actually quite painful to watch...sort of like when you watch a British series and some Brit has to play an annoying American and maybe for the Brit it sounds real, but for an American uh uh, you can tell.I also have another issue with casting. Really? Sorry, Woody Harrelson if you were a small town sheriff in your mid to late 50’s...that’s really your wife? That annoyed me probably more than the unnecessary casting of the ex-husband’s mid-life crisis girlfriend. Both instances were gratuitous and unnecessary. I’m halfway and going to try to make it to the end, but it’s going to hurt.","2.0 "

The IDEA of this film, the better version you imagine it to be, think it ought to be, is great.As with many modern movies and tv shows, roughly halfway through it turns into a kaleidoscopic fever-dream.  Character motivations are abandoned, stop making sense, the world stops making sense.  Apparently this entire small town is a completely consequence-free environment for anyone looking to do literally anything.Are we supposed to LIKE anybody in this town?  As far as I can tell, essentially EVERYONE is crass and contemptible... do the film makers hate middle america?  not to mention, as the movie progresses, the willing suspension of disbelief starts to fall apart.  It is as if a space alien was trying to write about how they think people in middle america think, behave, live their day to day lives.  Minute by minute, this lack of comprehension builds to a point where the film cannot be saved.  There are no people in this film.  The standins for them do not act like people.This film COULD have been done as a straight-ahead Winter's Bone type movie and would have been better.OR it could have been more of a folksy, slightly unrealistic Cowan Brothers type movieOR it could have been sort of an artsy and weird David Lynch type movieOR it could have been a sardonic, darkly comic movie like essentially infinite movies made in the 90's were, and worked.

Outside of one or two characters all the others had despicable traits.  SPOILER: from the cop committing suicide when he was dying of Colon cancer who in effect cancelled out any widow benefits from eating his gun to the grieving mother who also carried the burden of guilt for the events leading up to her daughters death...each major character had hideous flaws.

There is a quote in the movie, ""Anger begets anger"" and I think that is basically the theme of this movie.  A mother frustrated by feelings of guilt and a lack of closure regarding her daughter, lashes out at the world looking at everyone as a potential enemy when it's really herself that she loathes.  Then others, who had the right to be angry,(the guy thrown out the window), instead reacts with compassion toward the perpetrator.  He's like the Jesus of the movie, befriending the friendless(midget), helping the downtrodden(poor mad mom) and turning the other cheek(giving oj to someone who whomped him), showing that there are options other than anger.  As for Sam Rockwell's character, I think he depicts the individual who is susceptible to influence, whether it be anger or compassion (bad vs good), all he needs is someone to believe in him and he'll follow that path.  As for the Sargent, he's there to teach a lesson.  Watch the movie and figure out for yourself what he's trying to teach you.  Maybe it was all just in my own head, but I had a feeling that this was a movie with a message asking you to ponder it","4.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","What we would all like to do sometimes.","GPF","This provocative film takes all of the frustrations and subtle disappointments that we encounter in our everyday lives and sharpens them into brutally direct characterizations. The cast is superb, the situations a little exaggerated, but the motivation is clear. Laughing out loud, feeling disgusted by the failures of the human character, and wondering how anyone could possibly endure their tribulations in such a badly flawed small town are a few of my reactions as Frances McDormand's Mildred seeks justice for her murdered daughter. Some of the scenes are overly violent, but positively support the plot line. Satire mixed with pathos. ""When planning revenge, dig two graves"" best summarizes this unforgettable story of how a tragedy changes everyone who is touched by it..","5.0 "
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Dark...sad...brilliant acting & worth a few Oscars","IrishLass","You may not have liked the movie because of the violence and dark subject matter but the acting was superb.  And there were enough twisted  humorous  moments that elevated it to be worthy of the best picture nod.  You can definitely see where all the acting  nominations  came from they all deserve that Oscar.  For those of you who thought it was depressing ...We actually found it to be quite hopeful... a movie about pain,  change and redemption.  We Thoroughly enjoy this one.","5.0 "
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Unique Gem","JUNIPER","So good I watched it twice. Sam Rockwell is one of my favorite actors and was great in this (Oscar win) as a crooked, flawed  southern cop. Woody Harrelson is fabulous as the chief of police and the main character's nemesis/friend. Frances Mcdormand plays the main character and Frances is always flawless in her acting (Oscar win for this and Fargo).  Frances plays a mother who's heartbroken, guilt ridden, angry  and seeking justice for her murdered daughter in a southern poor town full of prejudice, bigotry and backwoods thinking. So many fine performances by other actors such as Peter Dinklage (GOT), Caleb Jones (Get Out) and John Hawkes (Identity) as well. It has dark humor, it's disturbing and heartwarming at the same time.","5.0 "
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Life is a work in progress and there are few neatly tied endings","Happy Chick","This is not a movie that you'll watch comfortably, that will be neatly tied up for you at the end. This is, at its heart, a movie about redemption and the different ways it's accomplished through mistakes, pain and realization.  Frances was AMAZING no doubt but Sam Rockwell(!) his character was off the charts well-done! I'm recommending it to everyone...with the proviso that like life it is a work in progress and there are few neatly tied endings.","5.0 "

Woody Harrelsons wife is at least 30 years younger than him.  Silly, gratuitous violence. I just don’t get the hype.","3.0 "
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Cannot say enough about the greatness of this film","K","The best movie I have seen in a long time. The performances were great. It did not have that contrived cheesy ending that out mainly Aristotelian society craves and loves. I knew this film would be great when the small town I live in only had it in the theaters for a week or so. That is usually the sign that the film might be a worthwhile cinematic journey, which it delivered on all counts. The acting and the characters were great. Others I recommended it to thought there was something wrong with me after they saw it. But, they found nothing funny about it whereas I did. Then again, I was reminded that I laughed at Heathers and told them to watch that also.","5.0 "

People love, hate, care, and change.  The darkest moments are leavened with martini-dry wit, which makes bearable (if not pleasurable) the entire journey.  The casting and performances are superb.

I especially enjoyed the clever dialogue, though there was plenty of action.  The characters were well-developed and the acting was fantastic.  I saw where one reviewer did not like the main character's (Mildred) behavior after what happened to her daughter--I think anyone who has a child can probably imagine what they might do if they were in Mildred's shoes.  Many films struggle with credibility, logic, and pacing, but this one did not.  I'm not going to write too much because I don't want to give anything more away.","5.0 "

It has a lot of suspense (not really like a thriller with knifes around the corner), but a great dramatic development of the story line that leaves one craving for more. The characters are brilliant and multi-faceted, the story line is intriguing and a bit bizarre. At no point in the movie are the dialogues obvious and story predictable. It is done very well in every aspect of the craft. Spoiler alert: The sort of open end gives it a bit of the touch of a french film. This is worth watching if you enjoy great movies.","5.0 "

I truly cannot think of anyone else who could have played her role.  You are on her side because all she wants is justice for her daughter's murder. You feel bad for the main character because in the midst of her fighting to get her daughter's case solved, she's fighting the sheriff, her ex husband, and her son. It seemed like no one was on her side.  I don't want to bring any spoilers to this movie, but I didn't know you can kick a female between her legs just like a dude.  I laughed so hard.","5.0 "
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Close to great, but the script asks the viewer to suspend reality too often when it simply isn't necessary.","Wine Me","This is a worthwhile watch, but you must overlook a few very near attempts to ""Jump the Shark.""  An adult assaults teenagers in front of a school with no repercussions, a cop beats a man within an inch of his life and throws him out a window in front of his new police chief and he is only fired, an ex husband pushes his ex wife against a wall, adult son puts a large knife to his father's neck to make him stop and a few moments later every involved behaves like it never happened.  And the police station is torched and everyone knows who did it, but the entire incident is simply forgotten.  If that kind of incredibly unrealistic storytelling is a distraction in a movie in which believability is paramount to the story, then you may find some annoying speed bumps in this otherwise very interesting story.","4.0 "
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Well worth seeing","BKR","Sam Rockwell was so good at playing a despicable character that I almost quit watching this halfway through - I'm glad I didn't. Rockwell and McDormand really deserve their oscars. This movie takes us through many types of grief and anger. But most important, it manages to make these characters very real people who aren't all good or bad - they live their lives, make mistakes, and sometimes learn from them. Best of all for me, there is no neat and tidy hollywood ending - but it's an honest one.","5.0 "

Cinematography is compelling. The main characters are 3-dimensional as each are eventually revealed as being neither all good or all bad.

The story line is pretty unsatisfying as well....spoiler alert....they don't catch the bad guy in the end and you are left wondering if our vigilantes will do in another for an unrelated crime. Woody Harrelson's performance added that much needed bit of levity to an other wise mundane plot line. Sam Rockwell's sudden change of heart after the fire was an interesting twist, but not unexpected. This film for me was missing that special something at the end.  Also, the overuse of vulgarity was not warranted. This film could have easily passed for a PG-13...but for sake of our love affair with the f-word, it got an R-rating.","3.0 "

Well, she’s equally good I’m both, but the characters are so different. There isn’t a single bad performance in ‘Billboards’. All great actors. Woody Harrelson, Peter Dinklage and others in supporting roles are excellent. You feel what they feel, or convey as actors. Sam Rockwell, as usual, does that amazing transformation where he is totally believable in his role and you either want to reach in and hurt him; or otherwise give him a pat on the back. It’s not a tear-jerker, but it will tug at your heartstrings and also give you a few laughs. I was disappointed when it ended because I wanted to stay with the characters to discover their fates.

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Plenty of hype but it falls short of the mark","Tina Ramsey","First off, there are no plot spoilers in this review. I wasn't incredibly impressed with this movie like many others were. I had heard really good things from critics and people on Twitter. However, I found the characters a bit dull and the story not only melodramatic but unauthentic. In the first half the movie didn't grab my attention and I was disappointed that I paid $5 to rent it. But I stuck it out since I had heard so many good things about it. The second half was actually better than I anticipated - the movie somewhat turned around, went in a direction I wasn't totally expecting. But I still feel that there was a lot missing from this film. I think the biggest factor may have been that there was really no backstory on any of the characters - even the main characters had little backstory explained. It's hard to empathize with them when you don't really know who they are. And some of the minor characters just seem like cardboard cutouts - Denise (Amanda Warren) and James (Peter Dinklage) really do seem stereotyped, which is ironic because the movie seems to make some attempts at breaking stereotypes down. To make a long story short, I think that the critics, trailers, and some of the people who viewed this movie before me hyped it up to a level that, in my eyes, it fell short of.","3.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Flannery O'Connor fans are gonna love it!","Amazon Customer","What an amazing film!  I must own this!!!  Okay, they had me at Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson, and still, I was initially skeptical of it being a must-see tribute to Flannery O'Connor's work... but, boy, was that my first surprise.  I was surprised over and over from beginning to end!  They seriously nailed the dark comedy and ""grotesque"" characterizations she is known for.  Red, the young billboard salesman, in one of the opening scenes is, in fact, reading a copy of O'Connor's short story collection ""A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories,"" ha ha... I love it.  If you know the eponymous story then you'll notice a few winks, including the name Red.  A good man (or woman) is indeed hard to find in these parts.Here we meet a cast of oddball small town characters representative of all our worst American stereotypes... ignorant, racist, lazy, violent, and just plain stupid and vengeful.  A woman lost in grief after losing her daughter sets off a snowball effect of pure madness when she rents out 3 billboards on some nowhere country road accusing the police of not doing enough to help find justice for her dead child.  What happens next is unpredictable and I won't spoil it... you'll be glued to the screen wondering what will happen next!  But I will say every key character takes a good long look into the abyss of the soul and what stares back ain't too pretty.  Is there any redemption to be had here?  I just don't know.  If there be any good country people here they exist only to be marginalized and shunned.If you loved this movie and are not familiar with O'Connor's work, I recommend picking up a collection of her short stories (she is best known for her short stories).  The Complete Stories or A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories... a unique brand of Southern Gothic literature.","5.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","A great movie with stellar acting and satisfying characterizations","Myrtle","A great movie with stellar acting and satisfying characterizations.  The mother's pain is palpable as is her conflict and guilt and anger and there is a frankly enjoyable aspect to watching her take things into her own hands. She is counterbalanced by the deputy who is similarly impulsive, but in an unsympathetic way, as he judges and attacks people without good reason. Still, there is a sort of redemption by the end, not through the retaliation we expect but in the ways the characters move beyond the need for retaliation. The mother manages to thaw and even to show compassion.  The deputy doesn't grow any smarter but he gains wisdom as he grows beyond his prejudices. By the end both have broken their personal cycles of anger and together start to reflect a bit on the potential consequences of their actions. I found the movie riveting, unpredictable, and moving, and the occasional bouts of humor that made me laugh out loud helped temper the mother's grief and pain.","5.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Disturbing, dark nonsense with good acting.","David Vaughn G","This is a dark and stupid movie that drags you along because of the good acting and hope for some sort of redemption/resolution. I guess the theme is rural America is full of bigoted , foul mouthed, drunken fools. They are also angry and anger begets anger.It was not funny. It was dark and disturbing. The ending is annoyingly open ended but the prior actions lead you to believe there will be more bloodshed. The only righteous character also resolves his predicament with gore. I love cerebral movies. This is just dark and disturbing Avoid this movie unless wish to see Woody Harrelsons best performance. McDormand's role is singularly bitter and would not stand alone without the more praiseworthy roles of the 2 leading men.Trailer is very misleading. This is not a crime solving drama and not a comedy. It is a dark and disturbing portrayal of an equally twisted family and police force. Hollywood filth and bigotry that is celebrated by the same people who are first to criticize it.","2.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","It's not an easy one to love","Jacqueline Druga","I truly debated on how many stars to give this. It was a roller coaster of love it, hate it for me.I had three movies to choose from to watch this evening. I chose this one, now I wish I didn.t. Not that it wasn't good, it was ... it was also disturbing and it left me feeling frustrated and blah.The acting was stellar, but I had a hard time getting past some of the character traits.While Francis McDormand's acting was excellent, She played a completely unlikeable character. I thought, you know it was the tragedy that caused her personality downfall, but the flashbacks prove she was never likable.I love Peter Dinklage but it seemed his character was wasted or a good part of his scenes left in the delete bin of Adobe PremiereThe over all storyline ... was really good. I watched until the end and there were moments that shocked me, had me on the edge of my seat and moments that made me cringe.SPOILER - if you are a person who needs an ending to a movie, then this may not be a good choice. The ending , for lack of a better word, sucked. I do, however, believe the REAL ending was changed., They set up the story to wrap really nice and perfect with a 'ah ha' moment, but then they abruptly switched it. If you watch it, you'll know what I mean. There was meant to be a different ending. It was set up for that.Warningif you are easily offended by racist, bigoted behavior.... don't watch.If it bothers you to watch people treat each other badly for no reason ... don't watch.If I based my review on the overall story and acting, it would be five stars.If I based it on the ending, it would have been one star.So I settled in the middle.","3.0 "

I found it thought provoking and compelling, although sometimes difficult to watch. If you want a tale of good versus evil, clearly painted with brushstrokes of black and white, you won't find it here. While this story is outwardly bold and dramatic, a subtle palette of grays is used to reveal shadowy corners of the human psyche. In contrast to the dark theme of revenge and retribution, glimmers of forgiveness burst through despair, offering hope and illuminating a path to redemption.The acting is excellent.","5.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Better trailer than movie","Mister Blister","This is a classic example of an AMAZING trailer advertising a movie that is just pretty good. Rockwell and McDormand both give excellent performances (as always), and McDonagh's dialogue's cracking dialogue dazzles (as always). There's just something...missing. I guess you could call it ""story"". There really isn't much of one. Too many subplots bog it down. I think this is McDonagh's weakness as a screenwriter/playwright (I have seen four of his productions on stage, including ""A Behanding in Spokane"" live on Broadway with Rockwell and Christopher Walken) and this seems to be something of a pattern.This film is worth your time, but don't expect it to live up to the buzz.","3.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","and instead of being nice and only fantasizing about smashing a detractor's head with ...","S. Vecchio","This movie is a minefield of possible spoilers, but what I CAN say is Frances McDormand is simply magnificent as Mildred Hayes.Mildred lives in ""The Show Me State."" Straightforward and tough, she is a true Missourian, and doesn't take one little bit of lip from ANYBODY!Even though I'm older than she is, I'm sure I'm not the only woman in that category who wants to be her when they grow up!After 7 months, the rape and murder of her daughter remains unsolved. With not even one lead in the case, Mildred, angry and grief stricken, has finally had it with the police, takes action, and the whole town is against what she does, and makes it known.Her creepy, overweight dentist's feelings are obvious when he does not even examine Mildred's sensitive tooth, and she has to request novicaine as he's picking up the drill.When he begins to admonish her as he leans in with the drill screeching, she grabs him and manages to cause him to drill a hole through his other thumbnail before she gets the hell out of there! (mentioned in the trailer)She is undaunted, and instead of being nice and only fantasizing about smashing a detractor's head with a boulder, Mildred is not below kicking them in the groin wearing her work boots.The subject of the film is so tragic, and Mildred is in such tremendous pain, the darkly comic scenes have to be outrageous to align with Mildred's character, and rise above the tragedy to be appreciated, and theycertainly do not dissapoint!Woody Harrelson, is perfectly cast as the level headed police chief in the small rural town, trying to keep a short leash on Sam Rockwell, who plays Dixon, a surely, idiotic, police officer prone to violence.I have loved Rockwell since his fantastic performance in ""Conviction"", several years ago with Hillary Swank.He is excellent as Dixon,  barely recognizable with how he completely changed his facial expressions to fit this characterThe cinematography was beautiful, the story was detailed, extremely well-paced, and did not drag a bit.Even the minor supporting actors rose to the occasion with performances that did not blend into the scenery. Nonetheless, this movie is all about McDormand.With such a strong character there is always a danger of it becoming one dimensional, and polarizing, because they become difficult to like, but  although we may think Mildred's actions are extreme, McDormand's nuanced performance allows us to understand and respect Mildred and stay firmly on her side.I think a lot of viewers were disappointed by the ending, but keep in mind, revenge is a dish best served cold. I almost missed an important detail, and I wonder if others that didn't like the ending missed it.","4.0 "

Take that with a grain of salt. I'm hard to please when it comes to movies. I have written fiction for a long while now and anyone who's ever called themselves a writer will admit to their own challenges as such. For me, it's endings. I tend to be long-winded in nature, verbally and in my writing, so wrapping it up is challenging. Maybe that's why most movie endings leave me feeling cheated. When I accomplish a good, solid ending to my writing, I feel good. Most movie endings anymore are vague and I find myself having to search for the metaphors. I'm not sure if that's intentional - maybe leaving it open for sequels, I guess. Anyhow, 3BB was pretty good, but I just didn't find myself believing it all the way. Your mileage may vary.","3.0 "

The dialogue is one extreme to the other and doesn't really match with what's going on in the scene. There is no resolution to the main plot. Side plots are simply props, don't work in the story: Dixon  (Sam Rockwell) is a psycho and tortures black people, but there's only, maybe, two black people in the whole town and neither of them seem to know Dixon. Not spoilers though, because they do NOTHING with that. It doesn't even keep focused on its central theme on Police corruption epitomized in this one family's tragedy. Absolutely no catharsis.

First, great performances from everyone, but the plot and writing itself is inconsistent in pacing and tone. The film jumps around too much and never seems to spend enough time with any one moment to create the sense of poignancy it seems to want to. Additionally, it's quirky for the sake of being quirky (a McDonagh hallmark that never bothered me before--I loved in Bruges and thought Seven Psychopaths was good). One example of pacing, tone, and inconsistency (SPOILER ALERT): Mildred's friend and co-worker, a person of color, gets arrested on trumped-up charges by an admitted ""torturer of persons of color"" and is presumably held in the jail where this torture occurred. Yet Mildred, whose mission is to hold the police accountable (this includes accusing them of racism, although her daughter wasn't Black) never seems particularly worried or concerned about her friend's plight or any danger she might be in. The move progresses with this person in jail most of the time. Then she suddenly shows up with a smile on her face, nothing about the racism, any mistreatment, the fact that the arrest was bogus, etc. They just hug and laugh and go about their business... Um, okay. Again, great performances, writing... meh.","2.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Brilliant screenplay, amazing acting and I now know who Sam Rockwell is for sure--and he's brilliant!","Juju Goes","This story won't leave you with all the answers and it certainly ends a little up in the air. That being said, Frances McDormand will grab you and keep you-she deftly handles most roles she plays, but this one she just owned from start to finish. I love me some Woody Harrelson also--and he's definitely good in this one, but Sam Rockwell deserves the Oscar and I hope he gets it. His character is not a nice man and Rockwell will make you hate him and even suspect him (well, okay I did, anyway) but you meet his mother and you begin to understand why he is the way he is. Then he runs into some misfortunes of his own (loses his mentor and winds up getting fired...and then FIRED) and it knocks the wind out of his sails a bit and the thing that really hit me was how he grabbed the murdered girl's file--in a raging inferno, he runs back to the desk and saves that one file, and you understand that he maybe did actually care about that case and then he's shown a kindness by someone who he would have expected to retaliate against him and you see the human condition in all its glory. The changes that take place within a person when they realize they have been wrong, so so wrong and reading a letter from someone who believed in him despite his many flaws, well he begins to change. Rockwell made me hate his character, feel sorry for his character, wish death upon his character, laugh at his character and then cheer his character on. We were along for this ride and the movie is brilliant--it must be watched more than once because I found myself dwelling on certain aspects of it and having 'aha' moments where I thought the way the characters were treated and why they acted and did the things they did was just breathtaking in both its simplicity and its complexity. Just a great screenplay and impeccable acting and Peter Dinklage? Never a false step from this man! He had a lesser role, but when he's onscreen, he is spot on and just a gem of an actor--all the acting was brilliant. I will watch this one over a few more times so I can see once again the moments I loved most but perhaps even catch some nuances I may have missed, as I'm sure there are plenty. This one isn't handed to you on a silver platter--it's a great movie for the masses, but perhaps a bit too cerebral for some who prefer something a bit more straightforward and easy to understand.","5.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","A Cop Out (Pund intended) Spoiler Alert!","fenx1200","In the opening scene Mildred is renting the three billboards at the advertising agency and there is a beetle stranded (upside down) on the windowsill and Mildred turns it over? What do beetles do best?  They can run....  And the action comes fast and furious with twists and turns, ups and downs, and a real roller coaster ride of emotions.  Her daughter was raped and murdered and she rents three billboards chastising the police into action in a small Podunk country town. This causes a public outcry and exposes the hidden feelings of all involved and this now turns into a battle of wills, and Mildred owns the toughest will of all. The tone is one of anti-police which is evident throughout the movie. Also, the theme of redemption is also played on heavily throughout the movie, as well as forgiveness. This movie is like playing chess, with sudden moves that upset the board, has many regrets all the while seeking justice and a moral equivalence as one group of people deal with tragedy, and this is passed on to another group, and so on. We have ex's, young girlfriends, suicides, and a lot of people getting the snot kicked out of them.  There is great character development, and Francis is great as always.  But the ending ruined the entire movie for me and that's why I am calling it a Cop Out.  With that said, I would definitely recommend watching this movie because it is truly something different and a very good movie (except for the ending). On a side note, Peter (James) really sums up Mildred's character who is letting her desire for justice turn her into an really negative person. James was perfect for this role.","3.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","The clue to understanding the whole film is this: What did the Chief do wrong?","D3042","This film reveals how much human damage a violent, abusive woman can cause.  After refusing to let her daughter drive to her friend's house, the girl is accosted, raped, and murdered while walking along a road at night.  Hearing no word from the police for seven months, Mildred lashes out in anger and rents three billboards near the scene of the crime.  Unfortunately for Mildred and the Chief of Police, stranger-on-stranger violent crime is extremely difficult to solve, and strong-female Mildred is too weak to pick up the phone and follow through normally.  She's upset because in all those seven months, the Chief himself never once visited her at home.  Mildred's only new idea is to demand DNA samples from every male in the town.  Mildred is of course the victim of an abusive past, and now finds herself in trouble for assaulting the local dentists, acting horribly to the Chief of Police, and committing arson.  If you wonder why the reviews are so polarized on this film, it is because people fail to understand its point of view.  We see the film through the eyes of Mildred, who is never at fault for anything, and is yet directly or indirectly the cause of everything.","4.0 "

So the daughter says ok, I will walk. O might get raped. Mildred says I hope you get raped too.It is not a simple case of mourning. She has that guilt of her very last words, and it is a driving force door her. To answer another question, the town turned against her because Willoughby was like Andy in Mayberry, the good old boy and because he has cancer the town tells he should not be hassled by that billboard with his name.Frances McDormand was twice as good as when she acted in Fargo. When you get involved with all the characters it is like a roller coaster where you switch sides several times.

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Good in the way that a Pixar short is a good movie","M. Morris","I gave it three stars mainly because I don't think the longevity for the movie is there. I don't think this is a Coen brothers type movie that people will be watching years down the road. There are two main problems I have with this film: One, the lack of an antagonist and two, the mixture of drama and dark comedy which simply doesn't mesh in this film. The lack of a really strong antagonistic force in this film really hurts it. Sure we know that there is a killer out there but we are never treated with any lingering clues as to who that is consistently throughout the movie. The only other antagonist could be the police department but that really falls hollow as you find out soon enough that the cops are either dunderheads or softies. And as far as drama and dark comedy it has no really emotional highs or lows and most of the characters are neither quirky enough and the gags are all unadventurous and cliche. I don't think any character is able to give it their all either. After seeing Frances McDormand in both Fargo and Burn Before Reading I feel like she has nowhere to go in this role and really has nothing to prove in this type of role. It showcases none of her edges she displayed in other Coen brothers films.","3.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Stereotyping rural Missouri","Doris E.","I was looking forward to watching this movie particularly after the Golden Globe Awards win, but disappointment and incredulity were my major emotions from the beginning of this movie. Based on the caricatures of small town Missouri people, this movie would have one believe we’re all a bunch of backwards, racist misfits. The movie wasn’t even filmed in Missouri, but in Georgia! If the writer had ever even flown over this state, it’s quite obvious our “hills” are not at all reminiscent of the Georgia “mountains”. Mr. McDonagh should stick to what he knows, England and Ireland. I feel like he made a mockery of the population and the culture. Sure there are some “rednecks” around, but the majority of the population is indistinguishable from the people of any state in the Union. We also are an educated and cultured people, enjoying the same access to post secondary schools, the arts and by golly, we have high speed internet as well. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the middle of the United States has become so red: the coasts have pushed us there with their narcissistic tendencies toward grandiosity in the comparison of themselves to the the unwashed and uneducated in the middle of our country. People of color are not the only disaffected population; we Midwesterners have been ignored, stereotyped and ridiculed. Oh great, no wonder we have become Trump’s base and stand behind him regardless of the each day’s newest event. We dig our heels in even deeper, finding any scrap of dignity in whatever tweet or event has caught the public’s attention and then stand proudly behind him in righteous indignation.I am not a conservative but the movie has deeply offended me and given me some insight into why Missourians and Middle America have been pushed into the arms of Donald Trump. Stop portraying us as simple minded, bigoted people. We are just as diverse as those on either coast and have much to offer, other than fodder for “dark comedies”.The characters, other than Ms. McDormand’s, were 2 dimensional at best.  The police chief was a “good guy” with the best of intentions, wanting to “save” not only his family, but Mildred as well. Given the script, Mr. Harrelson and Mr. Rockwell struggled to bring some depth and grit into their roles, but succeeded only in digging into their stereotypes more deeply. A deputy who emanates hatred and prejudice toward any one different than he? And the ex-husband! Of course he was a wife batterer who is now dating a 19 year old!  Why wouldn’t a young, beautiful, “slightly dumb” woman be attracted to this angry, vengeful man? Then of course, throw in a “fat dentist”, a “midget” and sprinkle in a few people of color, and voila, you’ve a a well rounded cast of characters! Ugh! Give me a break! Let’s just hope this does not win any awards tonight.  This was a disappointment at best.","2.0 "
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Mildly amusing, highly flawed film","Antiquity","This movie has some nice acting, some entertaining scenes, but has too many shortfalls to really be considered anything more than mildly amusing.  It’s like a fairly competently done attempt at a Coen Brothers film, but lacking witty humor and with too many cliched characters.  The 19 year old girlfriend’s character is straight from a “Big Bang Theory” sitcom episode.  The mean, racist cop’s sudden turnaround to morality is as sudden and unbelievable as an animated Grinch film, whose heart grows 10 times its size in a matter of seconds while reading a letter.  And while Frances McDormand is an excellent actress, her character confuses a strong-willed female character with a foul-mouthed thug and bully.The entire set up doesn’t even hold up.  Why is she posting billboards calling out the sheriff (played by Woody Harrelson), who we soon learn is a competent, friendly, fair man fully open to discussing the case with her and clearly interested in solving it?  Why is the racist, violent cop allowed to run rampant under Woody Harrelson’s nose, when a simple letter or talking to would clearly have worked all along?  Why is everyone in the town immune to any repercussions for violent behavior, arson, assault, and vandalism when a major plot point is the bringing of justice to a violent rapist?","2.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Typical Hollywood Trash","Royce","We've liked the actress from other movies she's done, so thought this might be worth watching, not knowing ahead of time what this was about.  It's a terrible script. The subject matter was disgusting.  Don't these Hollywood script writers and producers have anything better to do than to make up ugly/evil story lines?  Very unrealistic dialogue between mother and children, shouting foul words and sentiments towards one another. Bad/unrealistic acting scenes as well, there. Or is it realistic for a son to hold a knife to his father's throat,only to forget the incident, like a playful punch the minute a girlfriend enters the room? Most of Woody Harrelson's lines include the F word along with GD, even when talking directly to his young daughters. Vulgar conservations with his wife about sex. His character commits suicide within feet of his home where his wife and children live because he has cancer, and this is played out as if this act was somehow courageous and the right thing to do. Hollywood likes to give us their moral opinions about the worthlessness of human life. Then there's the white cop, who is violent and racist, of course. Did I mention he's white? Derogatory comments and behavior towards a dwarf for being a dwarf.  I wish the actor would refuse to play these type roles. It's demeaning, already. And then a white male soldier who is also,of course, a murdering rapist.  Did I mention the white male is also a soldier? Set in Missouri, most all the characters in the script are low-life uneducated types who are also not very smart, and short on morals and decency. Hollywood likes to represent American people, particularly Southerners, as poor ignorant trash. It's interesting so many actors themselves are uneducated high school dropouts, and drug addicts.  White poor people and white Southerners and dwarfs seem to be their choice targets to bully; American types they like to caricature and mock on the big screen to feel better about themselves. Hypocritical bores!  How about some positive, uplifting stories about everyday great Americans?","1.0 "

She is honest, does not hold back with her words, has been through hell and back, intelligent, sly humor,  and sticks up for her principles. We don’t usually run into people like this, and when we do we need to hang on. Mildred is not afraid of most people, and when her daughter died, she wants justice. Will she get it, well that is the premise of this film.The film has an overwhelming bent towards violence and anger and hurt, and how do we work through this mess.  Ebbing, Missouri, anytown, USA, where you wonder if anyone is happy.

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","""Anger begets anger""","Doug Park","The first half-hour or so vacillates somewhat, going around in apparent circles, but TBOEM delivers quite well in the end. This film is everything a noir comedy should be. It's satirical of many things: love, marriage, family, small town life, small town cops and police-in-general, life and mortality, younger people, and older people. Though, like most noir films, TBOEM is VERY profane, gritty, and violent, a subtle compassion and a definite moral ultimately comes through, and it avoids the pitfall of being tasteless just for the sake of being tasteless. Fine acting by just about the entire cast, with special kudos going to Frances McDormand and Caleb Jones. Fittingly ironic soundtrack too. The one or two brief scenes which digress from the steady dark humor of the rest of the film are well-done and effective, as is the beautiful scenery and cinematography. Finally, it's extremely gripping, always making you wonder what will happen next, with many surprises.Some of the more critical reviews have noted the various plot-holes in this film, which cannot be denied, but hey, it's comedy, which allows for more than the usual suspension of disbelief. TBOEM easily gets away with its stretches in the end.","4.0 "

Good, simple production and direction, allowing the actors to be the focal point of a movie and pulling it off is not as easy as one may think. It's about presence and making a story with the body of acting. No frills, just a solid examination of of nature vs nurture, extreme tragedy and human response mechanisms to it. Woody Harrelson gives a breath taking performance in this one. Not a role you'd expect Harrelson to shine in. But he does. He torches this performance like the sun, This movie is a study in human, in culture, in soul, in pain and wonder. Worth every cent and more.

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","An Unexpectedly Funny Film About The Consequences Of Your Anger Get Control Of You.","Gryphonisle","Not what I was expecting, and in a good way.  The subject matter---a desperate mother of a murdered child pays for 3 billboards, on a nearly abandoned road, criticizing the chief of police for not solving the murder---doesn't seem like a night's entertainment, but oddly enough, like ""Fargo"" there's humor in abundance in spite of the mounting tragedy of the film.  That the chief of police (played by Woody Harrelson) is dying of cancer isn't the surprise the critics I read made it out to be---Mildred Hayes (McDormand) says as much when he tells her.  The film is not based on any real life events (aside from a collection of billboards the director saw while driving through Texas) so when it strays off into Hollywoodland, as it does more than a couple of times, you feel it.  We wouldn't have a movie if Mrs. Hayes had been put in jail after her first violent freak-out, and it's not her last, but really, who hasn't wanted to kick some smart ass teenager where it counts?  It's what distinguishes us as adults, we know that's not what you do to them.The movie is full of characters, if light on character development.  If one cop has anger issues that keep him little more than a stereotype, the miserable piece of work that is his mother goads him on, reminding me of ""Throw Momma From The Train"".  Ooh what a nasty old thing she is. While the cops are mostly bad or useless---mostly useless---Chief Willoughby quickly rises above them even if Mrs. Hayes is too blinded by grief and self-loathing anger to see it.  And then, we get a new character---a black cop sent in from outside and things look like they're going to get better---but the characters are already set on their courses with no exits available and so he fades away almost as soon as he arrives, a rather strange development that suggests there was another plot line.If anything, the movie examines the consequences of unbridled anger, and the need to keep anger in control.  There are no real heroes here, by the end of the movie as Peter Dinklage's character describes her, even Mrs. Hayes has corrupted herself by surrendering to her anger. The ending is also unexpected, given the violent trajectory of the film thus far, but it worked for me.Over-all, and especially given what I was expecting, this was one of the more entertaining films I've seen in a long time. Not perfect, but a lot better over all than ""Shape of Water"" (a film set in the Jim Crow South of the Brown vs Board of Education era that eschews interracial relationships for interspecies relationships, and with a fish at that) and ""Lady Bird"" which was two hours of watching a willful spoiled brat fuss and fret.","4.0 "

I see it as a movie of a small town, where a horrible crime has been committed, and Mom just can not let it go. The other people in the town either support her, or try to pressure her to back off. There are no deep dark secrets or horrible conspiracies , just a whole lot of people who are a long ways from perfect. Like the rest of us. Even the tension between the sheriff and Mom is not without some acts of kindness. The worst bully in town surprised me. There is very little about it that is just like every other movie.

In the plot, a  grief-stricken mother decides to pay for a message on 3 co-located billboards. The words on those billboards set off a firestorm of controversy in this small town of Ebbing, Missouri and they have far reaching consequences as things quickly get out of hand. The writer and the director is Martin McDonagh who may have missed a chance to take it to a different ending, but the current ending is satisfactory, as is, and the screenplay also won a Golden Globe. Featuring an amazing, Oscar-winning performance by Frances McDormand that ranks up there with her “Fargo” performance of years ago, plus there is also a superb performance by Woody Harrelson as the town Sheriff, Oscar-winner Sam Rockwell as the beleaguered deputy, Caleb Landry Jones, Kerry Condon,  the ubiquitous  Peter Dinklage, Ziljko Ivanek, Abbie Cornish, Kerry Condon, and more.

I was expecting more of a drama and while it has a bit of that, it is more of a dark comedy with some dramatic elements.  I still enjoyed the movie mostly, but as the story gradually progressed into strange and crazy, it lost something to me as it just seemed the writer’s wanted to get more and more outrageous to prove their point, to the detriment of the overall story.  The ending also came up a bit short to me as well, leaving me saying “that’s it??”.Frances McDormand is great in the role of Mildred and Woody Harrelson, always knows how to play quirky characters and he is good here as well.  Sam Rockwell also plays his role well as the angry, idiotic Officer Dixon.This is one of those types of movies that is a bit different from the norm and from what you expect.  If you are looking for a dark comedy that is outside the normal realm of those “Bad (insert here) Trip” movie, this does have some funny moments and odd situations.

The gratuitous use of the Nword is meant to enrage the audience for the sole purpose of defaming white men from middle America.  Whites are portrayed as evil in this movie and the 2 black characters are portrayed as heroes.  There is an absolute race war going on in this country and its not what you think.

I will watch this movie again, and I will revisit McDormand's previous movies. If you have a heart and an open mind, this movie will move you emotionally and intellectually. These characters are what I taught my writing students as ""whole"" characters; those who possess all the favorable and unfavorable traits of persons living and dead. Don't despair; the ending, though somewhat vague, is clear. There will be a resolution, although not the one many might wish to have transpire.","5.0 "
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Difficult and beautiful","Michelle Y","It's been a long time since I watched a movie I loved so much.  It's not a comfortable movie, and it doesn't tie everything up neatly at the end and give it to you with a bow, but that's how life is.  The characters aren't caricatures that are all saccharine sweet or completely evil, they are a mix of good and bad like all of us are.  The movie itself is about redemption, about how you can go through unimaginable horror, but survive.  It would be nice if the movie ended with the kind of closure that people in America are used to getting from a sitcom, but real life isn't like that.  In reality, lots of murders are never solved, and even if they are solved, the suspects aren't successfully prosecuted for a million different reasons.  I didn't always like all the characters in this movie, but I ended up loving them by the end.","5.0 "
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","A great film full of great performances.","Charles Schoch","I really enjoyed it.  Every character is well fleshed out and - even while I don't agree with any of them - I understand why they act the way they do.  Everyone is flawed, nobody is the ""good guy.""  It's just people trying to make sense of a situation they do not understand and are not in control of.  I sympathized with Woody Harrelson, I sympathized with Frances McDormand, I even sympathized with Sam Rockwell by the end. They are people, trapped in a bad situation full of uncertainty, weighed down by their own baggage, and they do not always act rationally. The town is a believable place full of believable characters who surprise me with both how decent they can be to each other, at times; while simultaneously shocking me with how horrible they can be. The entire cast did an excellent job with their roles, even the minor supporting characters doing terrific work.I just thought it was a wonderful film and highly recommend it.","5.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","The best film of 2017","R. L Wright","My personal favorite film of 2017 and it deserves to win Oscars. I love Frances McDormand. This film will cement her place as one of our top actresses. I loved her in Blood Simple and Fargo (her previous win) but this film shows off her real acting chops as an embittered mother whose daughter was killed and not enough was being done to apprehend her killer. She was volcanic in her intensity and her crusade against the law is relentless. This woman was not one to give up !! Along with her great performance was a great role for Sam Rockwell who plays the redneck police officer who ends up becoming her ally. These two actors gave, what I felt, were the best performances of the year, and they are award deserving at Oscar time.","5.0 "
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","I used to resent characters like this or even think they couldn't possibly be real","tmycb37","I used to resent characters like this or even think they couldn't possibly be real, as some other reviewers have accused the writing and acting of being a bit unbelievable.  But moreso maybe than anger begeting anger; it begets awkwardness and strangeness.  Yes, you can face down your worst enemy and at the most opportune moment fear them or forgive them instead of met out your revenge.  Yes, you can waste time and money and energy like Ahab himself, on hoary crusades you cannot possibly win, to the loss and detriment of all around you.  And yes, your worst enemy can become your best friend, when you've both come to nothing left to lose, except for an even bigger mutual enemy.  The comedy injected in this film is effective, because it has to be, given the background subject matter.  And what makes us civilized?  Being civil.","4.0 "
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","A Woman's Fury","suzietoo","If you watch this movie and start thinking of all the things you can't accept, you are more than likely not going to like it. But if you accept it as it is......a gut wrenching, sometimes darkly funny, with a lot of violence that I felt would happen. Its a tale of a woman(Frances McDormand) and her fury with the local law enforcement. It all starts with those three billboards outside the town of Ebbing, Missouri on which she socks it to the investigation of her brutally murdered daughter. We have the usual asses, but there are some genuinely nice people. What I thought might be disappointing, turned into one of the best movies of its kind that I've ever seen. Stellar performances by all.","5.0 "
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","‘All this anger, man, it just begets greater anger.’","Grady Harp","Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) wrote and directed this very tough but brilliant story about anger, revenge, agony, prejudice – and redemption. Every character in this dramatic tour de force is drawn with equal parts hate and anger  - with a dollop of hope and forgiveness and reconciliation in the end. It is a phenomenal achievement.The language is saturated with foul/vulgar/trash type language but it fits the area and the particular character in this darkly comic drama. After months have passed without a culprit in her daughter's murder case, Mildred Hayes  (Frances McDormand) makes a bold move, painting three signs leading into her town with a controversial message directed at William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), the town's revered chief of police. When his second-in-command Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), an immature mother's boy with a penchant for violence, gets involved, the battle between Mildred and Ebbing's law enforcement is only exacerbated. Mildred’s son (Lucas Hedges) is seemingly the only stable character despite his absentee father (John Hawkes) and 19-year-old girlfriend (Samara Weaving) antics and his mother’s foul pained mood. The pinnacle of angry young men is policeman Dixon (Sam Rockwell in a brilliant performance) whose movements include severely harming the sign maker (Caleb Landry Jones) as well as violating all manner of laws. Peter Dinklage portrays James, the ‘town midget’ whose role is also key to the denouement of the action.Rape, murder, arson and many other forms of violence fill the screen but McDonagh makes it all make sense. McDormand, Rockwell, and Harelson are astonishingly but then there isn’t a weak member in this extraordinary cast. This is one of the best films of the year, despite the subject matter at the core of it. Grady Harp, March 18","5.0 "

And what a great journey this one was. I had seen the trailer and thought it looked like a quirky indie film with the usual rural bumpkin cliches and while it started off that way, Three Billboards abruptly hits the first turn in that twisty backroad that surprises and excites you to push on and see what's around the next bend. More black than comedy, the phenomenal cast at every level turns in stellar performances that reveal depth beyond the surface.

The constant grind of life eased by little bursts of of humor between folks who try but fail to complete a leap of understanding, one human being to another. The cost of attempting to speak 'truth to power,' the forced, unsatisfying compromises of life. Minimal, brilliant dialogue spoken by masterful actors, interspersed by their characters' silent, visually effective moments.Those moments of impenetrable agony merged to the middle of consciousness by the unstoppable pace of the soul's containment of events that carry us to the end.

It is a very moving experience to watch the characters' development and their relationships; the viewer's reward lies therein. The performances by Frances, Sam, and Woody are top notch. This is worthy of  awards and I recommend it if you can handle the above complex issues.","5.0 "
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","The attitudes of these characters reflect a tough-it-out approach to life that is very prevalent to the south and a stubbornness and pride that anyone who has lived in the southern states can understand and easily to relate to","Katherine K","The acting in this film was absolutely incredible. The attitudes of these characters reflect a tough-it-out approach to life that is very prevalent to the south and a stubbornness and pride that anyone who has lived in the southern states can understand and easily to relate to. While outwardly there is a thick-skin toughness to this attitude, everyone has a heart- sometimes it's just hard to see when it is in so much pain. This film reflects that extremely well. The story is rough and heartwrenching with the all the unexpected pitfalls life can throw. The writing is true to the language and attitude of Missouri, the pace and the plot true to the struggle, pain, and chaos that life can bring, and the ending is open- the characters questioning their motives and their decisiveness in their ultimate decision. Life brings uncertainty, pain, death, chaos, and sometimes there is no sure or certain way to deal with it. We go through life confused and hoping we are doing the right thing, but ultimately that unsureness claws at all of us- more fervently and most frequently when we are at our must vulnerable points. This film reflects that complex, unsteady feeling in life as a mother is determined not to give up on justice for her daughter, while dealing with guilt over their fragmented relationship prior to her daughter's death.Most of the complaints about the film are regarding three things- character complexity, ambiguous ending, and sad storyline. It has an ambiguous ending, but that doesn't reflect a ""lack of talent"" on part of the writers or a poor story. I don't quite understand why some people seem to expect that every story must end with a tidy little bow and a happy ending. The character complexity felt very real and true-to-life. One can be both happy at moments and concerned for the life and well-being of others while simultaneously mourning the loss of a child. One can also have their perspective and motive in life shift at the death of someone they held in high regard as an authority figure. These are not unusual concepts or character developments, they're natural and fluid. Rather than a predictable crime drama, neatly tied-up ending, the film (adapted from a book) captures human behaviour in extreme circumstances and acts as a question and commentary on how we deal with grief and lack of closure, and questions the morality of dealing justice as one sees fit. While we can sympathize, is the pain and lack of justice enough to pardon us our own crimes?","5.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Too implausible; misery stacked on top of misery","Maryland Mystery Fan","Surprised by the film's accolades . . .

The supposed redemption of the cartoonish, dim-witted officer didn't ring true, either.

As she has gotten older her face has revealed what she's feeling, and she can tell us what those feelings are by subtle changes in her smile or frown. Very subtle and very effective.

I can understand why it was nominated...it was boring. Boring independent movies, with well known actors, tend to win awards but are quickly forgotten .","3.0 "

I'm working on a screenplay and this movie script, along with Fargo, are my go-to examples of what I hope to write.  Can't give stronger praise than that.","5.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","That's It?","JMS","Another one of those movies with an ambiguous ending.  The writer needs to finish the film with a conclusive ending.  There is nothing rewarding or entertaining about finishing a movie and wondering how the story ends.  To me, it just means the writer lacks the talent to finish the story in a meaningful way.  The story ends 10 minutes before it should with the main characters leaving their options open.  Good acting, but a very disappointing ending.  I wish I hadn't spent the money.","2.0 "

If you like movies that create a love/hate feeling, maybe you'll find the movie interesting.  Dialog is pointless with no real mystery involved.  There is no crime solving other than 'maybe this one did it, nope, it was this one.'  Lack of true drama, no mystery, nothing shocking or suspenseful.  I'd rather watch a soap opera (and I hate soap operas).  Don't waste two hours of your time like I did.  Pick something else.","1.0 "

Many parts of the movie were a bit ridiculous, but the whammy was the ending. Imagine walking with a friend on a beautiful day and having a great conversation...""Oh Nancy, I was out on a date with Fred and he opened the door for me...I think I'm in love""...""Wow, Lola, that is great I'm so happy for you...when's the next date?"".....and then they both accidentally walk off a cliff.  That pretty much sums up the feeling of the ending. There are so many directions this movie could have taken to make it stand out, but the only direction it went...was straight down the drain. This storyline needs major revising.","2.0 "

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","Great Acting, but Not Much Else","J Cook","SPOILERS.  Honestly, I don't know why this movie is the ""darling"" of the awards season?  I'm a huge movie fan, but not one who has to have everything wrapped up in a nice tidy bow or who needs a ""happy"" ending.  I just don't get the point of this movie.  It starts off well enough, a woman gets fed up with the lack of progress on the investigation into the murder and rape of her teenage daughter.  She rents three billboards to challenge local law enforcement asking why?  Almost the entire town is against her.  That's the first thing that doesn't make sense.  Why would an entire town be upset at a woman asking for closure on the murder and rape of her teenage daughter?  One of the deputies, Dixon (Sam Rockwell), is a racist who has a pattern of beating young black men, yet the ""good"" sheriff overlooks that particular character flaw because he thinks he has the makings of a good cop?  After the suicide of the Sheriff (he has terminal cancer), Dixon gets upset and decides to attack the man (boy, really) who rented the billboards to Mildred.  Dixon proceeds to through him out of a two story window and then follow it up by beating and kicking him while he's lying on the street.  The new (black) sheriff has just come to town and witnessed the brutal attack.  He fires Dixon, but nobody arrests him or even talks about bringing him up on charges.  Why?  He blatantly attacked a man to within an inch of his life in an incident that was witnessed by several people, including the new sheriff!  Frances McDormand's character, Mildred, is flawed (as everyone is), but she goes to the extreme when she fire bombs the sheriff's office.  Dixon just happens to be in the office (it's closed - no one is on duty?) and gets caught in the fire.  He's burned pretty badly.  Really?!  Enter Peter Dinklage's character (he is totally wasted in this movie), James.  James helps Dixon by trying to douse the flames.  James has a crush on Mildred and has witnessed what she's done.  He decides to give her an alibi in exchange for a date.  They go out to dinner, but it doesn't turn out well (big surprise).  She's embarrassed to be seen with him (he's a midget), and he storms out of the restaurant.  That's pretty much it for Peter Dinklage.  Why was his character even necessary?  A disgraced, and disfigured, Dixon is drinking in the town bar when he overhears a guy in the next booth telling his buddy how he raped and burned a young woman (the same way Mildred's daughter was killed).  He picks a fight to get DNA from the man hoping that he is the killer.  He then goes to tell Mildred about it, getting her hopes up.  All of a sudden, Dixon seems to have gained empathy for Mildred when he never had it before.  When it turns out he's not the killer, Dixon and Mildred decide to go on a road trip to Idaho (they tracked the purported killer through his license plate) to find him and kill him because he must have raped and murdered someone.  That's where the movie ends.  Again, really?!  What was the point?  As I said, I don't need everything to be wrapped up (i.e., the murderer gets caught and Mildred lives happily ever after), I just need there to be a point.  The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because of the acting.  I was very disappointed and would not recommend this movie.","2.0 "

Moreover, every third word spoken in the movie is profanity, which comes across as being artificially inserted verses a natural part of the character portrayed. Someone should tell the bigoted Irish-Brit who produced this thrash, that in America we require that dog litter be bagged, and remind him to scoop his up and deposit into the appropriate bin on the way back to the UK.  I suspect his future movies will not have a big audience in the USA, and I am sure that Hollywood, for all of their crudeness over the last year, will give this movie an Oscar precisely because if it's lewdness and insult to America.","1.0 "
